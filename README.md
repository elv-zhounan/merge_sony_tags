# About merge tags from sony to our tags for search usage

## tasks done

- [x] download tags from fabric
- [x] translate from xml to json
- [x] merge to shot tags
- [x] a few analysis

## need to discuss

1. what features we would like to add
2. for search, seems like we are only using shot_tags tracks, can we just save shot_tags to make files smaller?
3. tags from sony is covering too many shots, which may not be a good case
4. sony xml format is not good, json files given by marc is good. are those json files from sony or marc?
5. maybe more analysis
