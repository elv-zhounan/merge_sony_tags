## need to discuss

1. sony xml format is not good json files given by marc is good. are those json files from sony or marc?

   1. some timestamps are empty
      - []
      - [00:00:00:00-00:00:00:00]
   2. sime timestamps are with bad formatfor example
      - [00:04:22:21-00:04:26;10/1.0]
      - [ [01:14:09:00-01:18:48:09]
      - not sure if there are any other special cases
   3. the content format:
      - in transcripts, sentences are seperated using -
      - in others, according to my check res, items are seperated using ;

   not sure if there are any other strang format I should pay attention to

2. what features we would like to add? currently I added:

   1. "description_keywords_timeline"
      - including object, emotion, action, places
   2. "description_location_timeline"
      - location, including from small buildings (library) to US states
   3. "description_memorable_timeline"
      - not sure, seems like summarizing what was happening in that time period
   4. "description_setting_timeline"
      - similar to location time line
   5. "description_theme_timeline"
   6. "description_tone_timeline"
   7. "facial_actorname_timeline"
   8. "facial_charactername_timeline"
   9. "keywords_audio_timeline"
      - provides some keywords in the audio
   10. "scene_shortdesc_timeline
       - summarying the scene
   11. "sony_acp_shortdesc_timeline"
       - summarizing the short story
   12. "sony_clipandshare_shortdesc_timeline"
       - summarizing the short story, not sure about the difference from 11
   13. "sony_clipandshare_title_timeline"
       - the title the scene (chapter)
   14. "sony_crackle_shortdescription_timeline"
       - scene short descrption
   15. "sony_itunesextra_shortdesc_timeline"
       - scene short descrption
   16. "sony_mdc_shortdescription_timeline"
       - scene short descrption
   17. "sony_music_title_timeline"
       - music title
   18. "sony_sceneslam_title_timeline"
       - ???
   19. "transcript_timeline"

   there are several kinds of scene discrption, we may need to drop some

3. for search, it seems like we are only using shot_tags track, can we only save shot_tags to make files smaller?
4. tags from sony is covering too many shots which may not be a good case
   - can view some results in shot_covered folder
5. more analysis if needed
