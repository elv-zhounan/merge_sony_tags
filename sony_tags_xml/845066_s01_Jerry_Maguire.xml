This lady here is my wife. [00:04:20:19-00:04:22:01] Hi, baby. [00:04:22:10-00:04:25:20] This is my boy. And this is.... [00:04:27:21-00:04:29:08] Wait. [00:04:30:08-00:04:32:12] My agent. My agent. [00:04:32:16-00:04:36:18] I gotta play this weekend. If I play at 65 percent... [00:04:36:22-00:04:40:12] ...I get a bonus. I gotta get the bonus. [00:04:41:10-00:04:45:20] -Okay, Jesse. Take care, little guy. -Mr. Maguire? [00:04:46:01-00:04:50:16] This is his fourth concussion. Shouldn't he stop? [00:04:50:20-00:04:53:23] It would take a tank to stop your dad. [00:04:54:09-00:04:56:09] It would take all five... [00:04:56:13-00:05:01:10] ...Super Trooper VR Warriors to stop your dad. [00:05:01:15-00:05:02:18] Right? [00:05:04:22-00:05:06:01] Right? [00:05:07:20-00:05:09:12] Fuck you! [00:05:12:11-00:05:15:21] Who had I become? Just another shark in a suit? [00:05:32:20-00:05:38:23] --skyrocketing salaries, and you are one of the guys responsible. [00:05:39:08-00:05:42:03] He's a sensational athlete. [00:05:43:10-00:05:47:11] Two days later, at our Miami conference, a breakthrough. [00:05:47:15-00:05:49:14] I have $18 million.... [00:05:49:20-00:05:52:16] Breakdown? Breakthrough. [00:05:52:21-00:05:56:14] -I just wanted an autograph. -Do you know your name? [00:05:58:01-00:06:01:20] I couldn't escape one simple thought [00:06:03:16-00:06:05:14] I hated myself. [00:06:07:03-00:06:08:20] No, here's what it was [00:06:09:22-00:06:13:00] I hated my place in the world. [00:06:19:02-00:06:22:03] I had so much to say, no one to listen. [00:06:24:11-00:06:26:03] And then it happened. [00:06:29:12-00:06:33:22] It was the oddest, most unexpected thing. [00:06:34:03-00:06:38:22] I began writing what they call a mission statement, not a memo. [00:06:39:03-00:06:42:17] A suggestion for the future of our company. [00:06:44:01-00:06:48:18] A night like this doesn't come along often. I seized it. [00:06:50:16-00:06:54:13] What started out as one page became 25. [00:06:54:18-00:06:57:21] Suddenly, I was my father's son again. [00:06:58:01-00:07:02:05] I was remembering the simple pleasures of this job. [00:07:02:13-00:07:06:19] The way a stadium sounds when my player performs well. [00:07:07:00-00:07:11:14] The way we're meant to protect them, in health and in injury. [00:07:11:18-00:07:15:22] With so many clients, we had forgotten what was important. [00:07:16:12-00:07:21:03] I wrote and wrote and wrote. And I'm not even a writer. [00:07:21:12-00:07:26:05] I was remembering my mentor's words, Dicky Fox, who said [00:07:26:15-00:07:30:16] The key to this business is personal relationships. [00:07:30:22-00:07:36:05] Suddenly, it was all pretty clear. The answer was fewer clients. [00:07:36:14-00:07:38:21] Less money. More attention. [00:07:39:01-00:07:42:02] Caring for them, caring for ourselves. [00:07:42:11-00:07:45:00] Just starting our lives really! [00:07:45:05-00:07:50:05] I'll be the first to admit, what I was writing was touchy-feely. [00:07:50:14-00:07:53:23] I didn't care. I've lost the ability to bullshit. [00:07:54:03-00:07:57:23] It was the me I'd always wanted to be. [00:08:00:15-00:08:04:06] I took it in a bag to a Copymat in the middle of the night and printed up 110 copies. [00:08:04:16-00:08:08:00] Even the cover looked like Catcher in the Rye. [00:08:08:05-00:08:12:23] I entitled it, The Things We Think and Do Not Say [00:08:13:04-00:08:15:13] The Future of Our Business. [00:08:16:16-00:08:19:04] That's how you become great, man. [00:08:20:02-00:08:22:04] Hang your balls out there. [00:08:23:06-00:08:24:21] Thanks. [00:08:26:07-00:08:30:19] -Everybody got one. -Some animals walk on two feet. [00:08:30:23-00:08:33:00] They don't want peace. [00:08:34:01-00:08:38:14] Society needs protection from these warped minds. [00:08:54:03-00:08:55:04] Boom! [00:08:57:18-00:09:00:15] This is Jerry Maguire. Did those manuscripts--? [00:09:00:20-00:09:03:01] -They've all gone out. -They did? [00:09:03:06-00:09:06:04] No, that's fine. [00:09:06:13-00:09:08:00] Thank you. [00:09:36:08-00:09:38:18] Finally, somebody said it. [00:09:41:01-00:09:44:02] -Good work, Maguire. -Yeah, yeah! [00:10:01:07-00:10:03:06] I was 35. [00:10:03:18-00:10:06:03] I'd started my life. [00:10:07:00-00:10:10:03] -How long do you give him? -About a week. [00:10:20:07-00:10:23:19] -You're with the sports people? -Jerry Maguire, SMI. [00:10:24:00-00:10:28:01] Bobbi Fallon, BPI. I'm producing the Coke commercials. [00:10:28:05-00:10:30:04] Well, good luck with that. [00:10:31:22-00:10:36:17] Hi, my son is allergic to the blankets. I was wondering-- [00:10:36:21-00:10:39:07] That's all we have, okay? [00:10:43:15-00:10:49:00] -I'm sorry if I was rude just now. -That's okay. We're in it together now. [00:10:49:05-00:10:53:04] Why is it so easy to talk with you? Tell me about your fiancÈe. [00:10:53:08-00:10:56:20] -We're not at your pitch yet. -Tell me how you proposed. [00:10:57:00-00:11:00:05] Honey, are you all right? Do you want some juice? [00:11:01:10-00:11:06:09] Thank you. We're hiking up through the pools. [00:11:06:18-00:11:10:22] Got the ring in my pocket. I'm a little nervous. [00:11:11:18-00:11:14:00] I'm lagging. She says to me... [00:11:14:05-00:11:17:07] ...get this Hurry up, klutz. [00:11:17:16-00:11:22:07] It bothered me somewhat. I got quiet. Then she got quiet. [00:11:22:16-00:11:27:04] I decide I'm not gonna propose. The mood is not right. [00:11:27:08-00:11:33:00] At this point I know she knows that I was gonna propose. [00:11:33:05-00:11:34:05] She knows I know. [00:11:34:09-00:11:37:06] -So we check back into the hotel. -How sad. [00:11:37:10-00:11:43:05] Little do I know that my assistant assumed that I've now proposed. [00:11:43:10-00:11:48:04] She's got a band to play Here Comes The Bride when we walk in. [00:11:48:09-00:11:51:23] -I love that song. -All the football guys are watching. [00:11:52:04-00:11:54:20] There's even an ESPN crew. [00:11:55:01-00:11:58:09] So I turn to her, sort of grandly say [00:11:58:19-00:12:01:09] This is me, klutz, asking you... [00:12:01:19-00:12:05:08] ...goddess of rock climbing, to marry me. [00:12:05:12-00:12:11:01] I took out the ring. I mean, I don't much like big scenes... [00:12:11:23-00:12:14:10] ...but she said yes right there. [00:12:14:19-00:12:17:19] Some of the toughest men in football wept. [00:12:19:05-00:12:24:18] -We're getting married in February. -You'll be married forever. [00:12:30:08-00:12:35:21] -What's wrong, Mom? -First class is what's wrong, honey. [00:12:36:12-00:12:39:23] It used to be a better meal, now it's a better life. [00:12:46:03-00:12:47:13] Ray? [00:12:49:06-00:12:51:00] Ray?! [00:12:52:02-00:12:53:03] Come on, buddy! [00:12:53:07-00:12:55:09] -High five! -Ray! [00:12:56:02-00:12:59:13] -Oh, God. Ray! -Excuse me, can I help you? [00:13:00:13-00:13:02:09] Jerry Maguire. [00:13:03:02-00:13:06:04] I work in your office. I was on a junket. [00:13:06:08-00:13:09:01] I know, Dorothy Boyd in Accounts. [00:13:09:06-00:13:14:08] You have the side middle cubicle with a poster of Einstein's face morphed on Shaquille O'Neal's body. [00:13:15:22-00:13:17:13] That's pretty good. [00:13:18:19-00:13:22:10] -What did you lose? -My son, my mind. [00:13:23:08-00:13:27:02] Ray! Ray! [00:13:27:14-00:13:29:23] Listen, Dorothy. Dorothy? [00:13:30:03-00:13:33:12] While I go look for him, grab this gentleman here. [00:13:42:02-00:13:45:00] You scared me. You scared me! [00:13:45:04-00:13:48:12] -Don't do that again, ever! -Okay, Mommy. [00:13:48:21-00:13:51:12] Ever, ever, ever! Okay? Ever! [00:13:51:22-00:13:53:04] Dorothy? [00:13:54:09-00:13:56:22] -Take care. -Thank you so much. [00:13:58:23-00:14:02:11] I loved your memo, by the way. [00:14:04:13-00:14:06:15] -You did? -Yeah. [00:14:09:23-00:14:14:09] Thanks. Actually, it was just a mission statement. [00:14:14:14-00:14:17:21] In this age, optimism is a revolutionary act. [00:14:18:09-00:14:20:05] -You think so? -Yeah. [00:14:20:09-00:14:24:10] I appreciate that. I didn't know if I should write it. [00:14:24:14-00:14:30:02] It was 200 in the morning. Some of the stuff I just, you know.... [00:14:30:14-00:14:35:03] No. That part about embracing what is virginal... [00:14:35:08-00:14:37:00] Just a second. [00:14:37:04-00:14:42:12] ...and force open the tightly clenched fist of commerce to give a little back for the greater good. [00:14:43:02-00:14:47:15] God, I was inspired, and I'm an accountant, you know? [00:14:48:00-00:14:52:10] I mean, to respect yourself enough to say it out loud. [00:14:52:15-00:14:57:03] To put yourself out there like that, so nakedly. [00:14:58:09-00:15:01:07] I don't know. It got me. [00:15:05:07-00:15:08:02] Is this bothering you? [00:15:08:07-00:15:11:15] No, this is great. [00:15:12:14-00:15:14:15] -It's great. -One, two, three! [00:15:15:07-00:15:17:12] Do you need a ride? You okay? [00:15:17:22-00:15:19:06] -What? -Need a lift? [00:15:20:04-00:15:24:14] Oh, no! Yeah, I'm sure that would just make your day. [00:15:25:00-00:15:28:22] To drive us out to Manhattan Beach. Little tiny streets. [00:15:29:02-00:15:33:11] Playing chicken with traffic. Your life flashing before you. [00:15:34:14-00:15:38:06] -I've obviously had too much coffee. -No problem. [00:15:38:11-00:15:43:10] Oh, there's my sister, Laurel, to pick us up. [00:15:46:15-00:15:48:07] Ray... [00:15:48:15-00:15:50:00] ...Dorothy. [00:15:50:12-00:15:52:01] Pleasure. [00:15:53:00-00:15:54:11] Bye. [00:16:02:11-00:16:05:13] Hey, Ray, hey you. I'm double-parked, let's go. [00:16:05:18-00:16:08:14] Sorry, honey. Is this everything? [00:16:10:03-00:16:13:04] -Come here. -Dorothy? [00:16:14:01-00:16:18:12] Man, whoever snagged him must be some classy babe. [00:16:20:12-00:16:25:07] Don't ever stop fucking me! [00:16:25:16-00:16:29:01] Sooner or later we'll have to stop! [00:16:30:02-00:16:33:16] Never been better! Never better! [00:16:34:01-00:16:36:12] Never better! [00:16:40:02-00:16:41:14] Open your eyes. [00:16:42:00-00:16:47:07] If you want me to be with another woman for you, I would do it. [00:16:47:11-00:16:51:10] I'm not interested in it. At a time it felt normal. [00:16:51:19-00:16:54:17] But it was a phase. A college thing. [00:16:55:03-00:16:58:12] Like torn Levi's or law school for you. [00:16:58:16-00:17:00:17] Want anything from the kitchen? [00:17:08:01-00:17:11:14] You don't have to tell me everything. [00:17:11:19-00:17:14:02] This is what intimacy is. [00:17:14:14-00:17:17:12] We have dinner with Wade Cooksy tomorrow. [00:17:17:15-00:17:19:17] I know about the party. [00:17:20:03-00:17:23:07] Your buddy worked his ass off for this. [00:17:23:12-00:17:26:19] All the guys from the office are coming. [00:17:27:04-00:17:32:12] Calm down, relax, act surprised, and have an amazing time. [00:17:40:09-00:17:46:03] -Oh, my God. You! You! -Sorry. [00:17:46:08-00:17:48:04] Jerry! [00:17:48:20-00:17:50:14] Got you! [00:17:54:09-00:17:59:09] -Hey, college buddy. Congratulations. -Thank you. [00:18:00:07-00:18:02:06] -For you. -Thank you. [00:18:02:10-00:18:07:17] And this is for you. Finest cigar my club has to offer. [00:18:08:04-00:18:09:21] This is what it's all about, man. [00:18:11:13-00:18:13:06] Everybody loves you. [00:18:15:11-00:18:17:09] Pisses me off! [00:18:18:09-00:18:21:17] Whether you're country, redneck or a freak... [00:18:22:02-00:18:26:05] ...young or old, from Moscow, London or Memphis... [00:18:26:10-00:18:30:11] ...Jerry Maguire will still be the king of rock 'n' roll. [00:18:31:14-00:18:36:21] -Little black book. -When I think of him, my heart pounds. [00:18:37:08-00:18:41:09] -I know Jerry pretty well. -Hi, Jerry, remember me? [00:18:41:18-00:18:43:09] We still on for lunch? [00:18:43:14-00:18:45:14] He was no slouch in bed. [00:18:45:17-00:18:49:03] This is the funniest thing. See you later. [00:18:49:08-00:18:53:15] --good idea that Jerry get married. He won't be alone. [00:18:53:19-00:18:56:08] -He cannot be alone. -He can't be alone. [00:18:56:12-00:18:57:17] He's almost phobic. [00:18:57:21-00:19:02:12] Jerry is great at friendship, he's just bad at intimacy. [00:19:02:16-00:19:05:19] -He can't be alone. -He can't be alone. [00:19:06:03-00:19:11:06] -He can't say, I love you. -He's an agent. He lies. [00:19:11:10-00:19:14:19] -I love you too. -Hey, love you too. [00:19:15:04-00:19:17:15] -Love you too. -Love you. [00:19:17:21-00:19:18:21] I love you, man. [00:19:22:15-00:19:24:20] -I love you. -I love you. [00:19:38:13-00:19:42:12] -Morning, Jenny. -Sorry I missed the party. [00:19:42:16-00:19:45:08] Good morning, Jerry. Marcee's here. [00:19:45:12-00:19:48:11] She's late for her plane to Phoenix. [00:19:49:14-00:19:51:17] -Marcee. -You finally made it. [00:19:51:21-00:19:54:06] Rod is very, very upset. [00:19:54:10-00:19:56:21] -Tyson, no! -Okay, Mommy. [00:19:57:06-00:20:00:10] -Tyson, hello. -Long time no see! [00:20:00:14-00:20:03:05] -Tyson! -How can I help? [00:20:03:10-00:20:07:11] Jerry, I'm pregnant, and I'm incapable of bullshit. [00:20:07:16-00:20:09:09] Where is our offer? [00:20:09:14-00:20:12:19] -Cronin's for lunch? -This is Bob Sugar. [00:20:12:23-00:20:14:15] -Knock. -Pleasure. [00:20:15:08-00:20:18:16] -You've called our house. -Sorry to interrupt. [00:20:19:17-00:20:24:17] I don't know what you do, but my husband has an image. [00:20:24:21-00:20:30:00] Putting him in a waterbed commercial? You're making him common. [00:20:30:05-00:20:34:20] He deserves the big four Shoe, car, clothing, soft drink. [00:20:35:06-00:20:37:18] I know about the four endorsement jewels. [00:20:38:13-00:20:41:12] -Wow. -He and I majored in marketing. [00:20:41:17-00:20:42:19] We came to play! [00:20:43:18-00:20:46:20] The dirty man is back! [00:20:49:20-00:20:52:00] -Hey. -Hey, buddy. [00:20:55:12-00:20:57:00] You okay? [00:20:58:22-00:21:03:09] -Fine. What's up? -Came here to let you go. [00:21:04:16-00:21:07:22] -Pardon me? -Came here to fire you, Jerry. [00:21:13:13-00:21:15:18] It's real. You should say something. [00:21:24:00-00:21:25:12] Shit. [00:21:27:10-00:21:30:22] A crowded restaurant so there won't be a scene. [00:21:41:00-00:21:45:21] -You ungrateful-- -You need to see yourself. [00:21:46:02-00:21:49:16] You said fewer clients, you put it on paper. [00:21:49:21-00:21:53:14] You know what I went through? Fire my mentor? [00:21:53:19-00:21:57:20] Carrying that for a week? Could you get past yourself? [00:21:59:17-00:22:01:13] -You'll lose. -You want smaller. [00:22:01:19-00:22:05:01] Now I want all my clients and yours too. [00:22:06:15-00:22:07:17] Whatever. [00:22:26:00-00:22:28:12] Wendy, bring me my numbers. [00:22:43:20-00:22:45:14] -Cush. -Cush, it's Sugar. [00:22:45:20-00:22:51:22] Look, you're the most important guy in sports. How does that feel? [00:22:52:03-00:22:56:03] I just wanna play football. Dad, one of the agents. [00:22:56:12-00:23:00:13] Wendy, Cushman's line is busy! Call till you get through. [00:23:00:17-00:23:02:15] And bring me my numbers! [00:23:02:19-00:23:06:15] J.J., what's up? Have you talked to Maguire? [00:23:06:20-00:23:10:19] He had a meltdown. I've talked to Doritos about you. [00:23:11:00-00:23:13:13] They're interested. Talk to Rick. [00:23:13:17-00:23:15:11] Martinez.... [00:23:15:15-00:23:19:12] Carlo, right now you pay 25 percent to SMI. [00:23:19:17-00:23:22:02] I'd cut my commission by 7 percent. [00:23:22:11-00:23:25:23] I don't know if it was drugs, but the guy freaked. [00:23:26:04-00:23:30:04] Do you want him representing you? How's your mom? [00:23:30:13-00:23:33:13] I'm gonna make this easy for you. [00:23:33:18-00:23:36:16] Just what does your heart tell you? [00:23:38:21-00:23:40:04] Sorry to hear that. [00:23:45:04-00:23:50:03] -Hey, what's going on? -They've fired Jerry Maguire. [00:23:50:12-00:23:54:10] SMI, this is Cleo. Hey! [00:23:59:03-00:24:01:02] You're making a mistake. [00:24:01:12-00:24:06:02] I'm concerned about your family and your future. [00:24:06:11-00:24:09:17] I have a long relationship with SMI. [00:24:09:22-00:24:12:15] Does he know what it's like to be black? [00:24:12:19-00:24:15:04] Bob Sugar? He's.... [00:24:15:13-00:24:17:22] He's entertaining, funny. [00:24:18:02-00:24:22:01] I don't know what it's like to be a black person? I'm Mr. Black People! [00:24:22:05-00:24:24:19] Don't make it harder than it is. [00:24:25:00-00:24:29:13] I've got to be honest, this is very distressing for me. [00:24:29:16-00:24:33:15] Remember that stripper's name? I do, it was April. [00:24:33:20-00:24:39:03] That's my job. It's not about the money, I do it all for you. [00:24:39:18-00:24:43:20] -Still holding for Katarina. -I'm talking about money. [00:24:44:00-00:24:46:14] It's been a great day. [00:24:46:18-00:24:49:21] Are you in or out? It's show business. [00:24:51:04-00:24:52:23] You are in. [00:24:54:12-00:24:58:06] -That's good. -I wanna cry for what they did to you. [00:24:59:01-00:25:03:18] If it wasn't for the Acura deal, you know I'd go with you. [00:25:03:23-00:25:08:15] Oh, Jerry. Oh, God! [00:25:10:12-00:25:14:12] Call waiting. Who could be calling me now? [00:25:14:16-00:25:17:00] -Hi, Kathy Sanders. -Still me. [00:25:21:16-00:25:26:14] Kathy, why are you crying? Oh. So you're in? [00:25:26:17-00:25:29:17] Rod, Jerry Maguire. How are you doing? [00:25:29:21-00:25:33:20] Jerry Maguire! How am I doing? [00:25:34:01-00:25:37:14] I'll tell you. I'm sweating my contract. [00:25:37:18-00:25:41:15] Bob Sugar says I'm missing out by being with you. [00:25:41:19-00:25:45:23] -That's how I'm doing. -That's why I'm calling. [00:25:46:03-00:25:50:05] No, I hear that you hear what I'm saying. But do you truly hear what I'm saying? [00:25:50:15-00:25:55:15] -I heard you say it, Daddy. -The best thing is getting together. [00:25:55:19-00:26:00:02] -Would you mind holding? - Hold up. Didn't you tell my wife more personal attention. [00:26:01:01-00:26:06:08] -Did you not tell my wife that? -I said more personal attention. [00:26:06:17-00:26:11:22] Good! We're just getting started on the things you need to know. [00:26:12:03-00:26:14:22] I will kill for you. I will maim for you. [00:26:15:03-00:26:18:04] I am a valuable commodity! [00:26:18:14-00:26:23:22] I see a dude out to kill me, I tell myself, Catch the ball. [00:26:24:03-00:26:27:00] Booyah. Touchdown! I make miracles happen. [00:26:27:04-00:26:29:01] Are you in or out? [00:26:29:05-00:26:32:21] I'm from Arizona. I broke Arizona records. [00:26:33:01-00:26:36:05] I went to Arizona State! I'm a Sun Devil! [00:26:36:14-00:26:39:21] -And now you want Arizona dollars. -Exactly. [00:26:40:02-00:26:44:23] Jerry, I'm sitting here with an ant problem. I got ants. [00:26:45:00-00:26:47:08] My brother's TP's room is flooded. [00:26:47:18-00:26:50:19] -Rod. -We got a flood in his room. [00:26:51:00-00:26:52:16] Say hello to Jerry Maguire. [00:26:52:20-00:26:55:08] -Hello, brother Maguire. -Hello, Tee Pee. [00:26:55:16-00:27:01:00] My house is falling apart! Nobody's looking out for Rod Tidwell. [00:27:01:04-00:27:04:20] And I'm supposed to be a superstar. [00:27:05:00-00:27:07:05] I need a decision. In or out? [00:27:07:09-00:27:11:04] You're gonna be so happy you stayed with Bob Sugar! [00:27:11:09-00:27:16:08] I am a role model. I have a family to support! Hear me? [00:27:16:18-00:27:19:07] I want my new contract in Arizona! [00:27:19:17-00:27:22:09] But I like you. Yes, I like you. [00:27:22:19-00:27:26:17] My wife likes you. You're good to my wife. [00:27:26:21-00:27:30:00] -I will stay with you. -That's great. [00:27:30:04-00:27:31:09] -Are you listening? -Yes. [00:27:31:18-00:27:34:20] That's what I'm gonna do for you. God bless. [00:27:35:00-00:27:38:16] This is what you'll do for me-- Are you listening? [00:27:38:21-00:27:42:19] What can I do for you? Just tell me, what can I do? [00:27:43:00-00:27:46:22] It's a very personal, very important thing. [00:27:47:03-00:27:48:22] It's a family motto. [00:27:49:02-00:27:50:09] -You ready? -Ready. [00:27:50:18-00:27:52:19] Making sure you are, brother. [00:27:53:11-00:27:55:00] Here it is [00:27:56:22-00:27:58:11] Show me the money. [00:28:00:22-00:28:02:01] Show... [00:28:02:23-00:28:06:04] ...me the... [00:28:06:08-00:28:08:04] ...money! [00:28:09:04-00:28:11:05] Jerry, doesn't that make you feel good just to say that? [00:28:11:19-00:28:15:05] -Say it with me one time, Jerry. -Show you the money. [00:28:15:09-00:28:18:18] You can do better than that! I want you to say it! [00:28:18:22-00:28:23:00] -Bob Sugar's on the other line. I better hear you say it. -Show you the money. [00:28:23:04-00:28:27:19] -No, not showyou, show me the money. -Show me the money. [00:28:27:23-00:28:29:23] -Louder! -Show me the money. [00:28:30:03-00:28:32:23] -You got to yell! -Show me the money! [00:28:33:04-00:28:36:21] -I need to feel you. -Show me the money! [00:28:37:01-00:28:39:19] Show me the money! [00:28:40:04-00:28:43:11] Show me the money! [00:28:43:20-00:28:47:01] -You love this black man. -I love the black man! [00:28:47:05-00:28:50:07] -Show me the money! -I love black people! [00:28:50:11-00:28:52:05] I love black people! [00:28:52:10-00:28:56:05] -Who's your motherfucker? -You're my motherfucker! [00:28:56:08-00:29:00:19] -What you gonna do, Jerry? -Show me the money! [00:29:01:07-00:29:03:19] Congratulations, you're still my agent. [00:29:34:02-00:29:37:20] Well, don't worry. [00:29:39:11-00:29:42:03] I won't do what you think I will... [00:29:42:08-00:29:44:08] ...which is just flip out! [00:29:49:05-00:29:52:11] Let me just say... [00:29:53:01-00:29:57:05] ...as I ease out of the office I helped build. [00:29:57:09-00:30:00:04] I'm sorry, but it's a fact... [00:30:00:09-00:30:04:13] ...that there's such a thing as manners. [00:30:06:05-00:30:08:12] A way of treating people. [00:30:11:05-00:30:13:07] These fish have manners. [00:30:13:11-00:30:16:04] These fish have manners. [00:30:17:00-00:30:20:07] In fact, I'm starting a new company... [00:30:20:12-00:30:23:11] ...and the fish will come with me. [00:30:23:21-00:30:26:20] Call me sentimental... [00:30:27:00-00:30:30:00] ...but the fish are coming with me. [00:30:39:07-00:30:40:23] Okay. [00:30:44:02-00:30:48:05] If anybody else wants to come with me... [00:30:48:10-00:30:51:12] ...this will be a moment of something... [00:30:51:22-00:30:55:01] ...real and fun and inspiring... [00:30:55:05-00:30:58:01] ...in this godforsaken business... [00:30:58:06-00:31:00:21] ...and we will do it together. [00:31:03:10-00:31:05:08] Who's coming with me? [00:31:05:12-00:31:07:05] Who's coming with me? [00:31:08:05-00:31:10:08] Who's coming with me?! [00:31:14:04-00:31:18:03] Who's coming with me besides Flipper here? [00:31:24:13-00:31:26:15] This is embarrassing. [00:31:32:01-00:31:33:10] All right. [00:31:34:21-00:31:36:11] Wendy. [00:31:37:00-00:31:39:14] -Shall we? -Oh, Jerry... [00:31:39:23-00:31:43:06] ...I'm three months away from the pay increase. [00:31:48:02-00:31:49:07] Okay. [00:31:50:04-00:31:52:01] Okay. [00:31:59:10-00:32:02:04] I will go with you. [00:32:02:16-00:32:05:13] Dorothy Boyd, thank you. [00:32:12:12-00:32:14:12] Right now? [00:32:16:17-00:32:18:15] Don't do it. [00:32:24:23-00:32:26:14] Bye. [00:32:35:15-00:32:39:17] We'll see you all again. Sleep tight. [00:32:41:17-00:32:44:13] Let's see how they do without us. [00:32:58:07-00:32:59:22] Thank you. [00:33:01:01-00:33:03:18] You will have a medical program, right? [00:33:04:04-00:33:06:11] Sure, yes, medical. [00:33:07:14-00:33:09:09] I don't know. [00:33:10:15-00:33:14:12] When you think about what you did, don't panic. [00:33:14:17-00:33:17:01] We're gonna be great. [00:33:17:06-00:33:20:18] We're gonna be great! [00:33:54:01-00:33:56:04] I wonder what he said. [00:33:56:12-00:33:59:05] My favorite aunt is hearing-impaired. [00:33:59:10-00:34:02:16] He just said, You complete me. [00:34:24:08-00:34:28:13] That's a good point. We come to support each other... [00:34:28:18-00:34:31:14] ...but we don't listen to one another. [00:34:31:18-00:34:36:09] Women are taught not to see each other as good people. [00:34:36:13-00:34:40:16] We see each other as enemies. We compete over men, jobs-- [00:34:41:02-00:34:46:04] -It's true, we compete. -I used to really hate women. [00:34:46:08-00:34:50:11] And then I met you guys, and you're like me. [00:34:50:15-00:34:54:09] It's important because I know you can be my friends. [00:34:55:02-00:34:57:18] -What about medical? -Of course. [00:34:58:04-00:35:00:14] A single mother can't be frivolous. [00:35:00:18-00:35:06:05] If you read what he wrote, you'd have left too. And there are other jobs. [00:35:06:09-00:35:10:09] -Do you know the cost of child exams? -Yes, $150. [00:35:10:14-00:35:12:10] And that's when he's well. [00:35:12:14-00:35:16:08] -Where is Ray? -Asleep in the living room. [00:35:16:12-00:35:18:14] Next time you lecture me... [00:35:18:18-00:35:23:07] ...don't leave my boy alone with that divorced women's group. [00:35:23:11-00:35:27:15] So I finally, finally got in touch with my anger. [00:35:36:18-00:35:39:05] What did I do? [00:35:40:13-00:35:44:05] Function, function. Forward motion is everything. [00:35:44:09-00:35:46:19] Cush saves all. [00:35:47:05-00:35:51:12] You go to Texas. Keep one superstar, and they'll all follow. [00:35:51:17-00:35:53:10] There's no loyalty. [00:35:53:15-00:35:56:21] The first person who told me that was you. [00:35:57:05-00:36:00:19] -I was trying to sleep with you. -Well, it worked. [00:36:01:05-00:36:06:08] And I will not let you fail. You are Jerry Ma-fucking-guire! [00:36:06:12-00:36:09:08] -That's right. -King of the house calls! [00:36:09:13-00:36:12:10] -Master of the living room. -Okay, okay. [00:36:12:15-00:36:17:06] -Okay, this is working. -You are not a loser. [00:36:19:04-00:36:24:10] -Who said anything about loser? -Mistake. Wrong word! Let's leave. [00:36:53:11-00:36:56:08] I'm in the back den, Jerry. [00:36:57:16-00:37:00:12] -Would you like a bloody beer? -I'm fine. [00:37:00:17-00:37:02:21] Beer and tomato juice. [00:37:03:14-00:37:04:23] I'm fine. [00:37:05:11-00:37:08:00] We've spent a lot of time together, Matt. [00:37:08:09-00:37:10:20] You know I care about you and your son. [00:37:11:05-00:37:15:06] You know I'm a straight shooter. If you stay with SMI-- [00:37:15:10-00:37:18:08] We decided to stay with you. [00:37:25:08-00:37:27:11] I'm not really a hugger. [00:37:28:07-00:37:30:00] I can't let go. [00:37:30:09-00:37:35:11] I told myself, If he shows up, we stick with him. [00:37:37:00-00:37:40:13] -Hey, Jerry. How's it going? -Hey, Cush. [00:37:40:17-00:37:42:13] How are you? [00:37:43:09-00:37:45:12] -You remember Keith? -Yeah. [00:37:45:16-00:37:50:08] I want him to go number one in the draft, and I want him to play. [00:37:50:11-00:37:53:23] It'll either be Denver or San Diego. He'll go first. [00:37:54:08-00:37:56:12] I'll either surf or ski. [00:37:56:18-00:38:00:09] -Denver's where he should be. -I'll give it everything. [00:38:00:13-00:38:05:12] You know I don't do contracts, but what you do have is my word. [00:38:07:07-00:38:09:16] And it's stronger than oak. [00:39:00:11-00:39:03:13] -Hello. -Dorothy? Jerry Maguire. [00:39:03:17-00:39:08:02] -Is Avery there? -She had an NFL meeting in Atlanta. [00:39:11:10-00:39:13:18] -Jerry. -Hello? Hello? [00:39:13:23-00:39:17:18] Sorry, that was my son and the nanny. [00:39:17:22-00:39:22:17] -They're in our office? -Nanny? I prefer child technician. [00:39:22:21-00:39:27:17] I had the calls transferred to my house so I could work here. [00:39:27:21-00:39:30:11] That's fine. Dorothy, we are back. [00:39:30:15-00:39:33:19] We are so very, very back. [00:39:33:23-00:39:36:01] I re-signed Cush. We're set. [00:39:36:11-00:39:39:19] -I am so happy for you. -Happy for us. [00:39:39:23-00:39:43:09] Happy for us. Okay, happy for us. [00:39:43:16-00:39:46:02] Rod, being at the draft is good. [00:39:46:11-00:39:50:17] No, Rod, just get on the plane and meet us at the gate. [00:39:50:21-00:39:53:14] -Good. See you there. -God bless. [00:39:53:19-00:39:57:03] Avery will meet you at the B-gate at 415. [00:39:57:13-00:40:01:11] Do you know the human head weighs eight pounds? [00:40:02:14-00:40:07:22] Did you know Troy Aikman, in six years, has passed for 16,303 yards? [00:40:08:22-00:40:13:21] -Bees and dogs can smell fear. -I booked Tidwell at the Marriott. [00:40:14:02-00:40:16:14] -Does he smoke? -I don't know. [00:40:16:19-00:40:22:01] Did you know Pete Rose has 4256 hits and he's not in the Hall of Fame? [00:40:22:12-00:40:26:16] Do you know that my neighbor has three rabbits? [00:40:28:12-00:40:30:13] I can't compete with that. [00:40:32:04-00:40:35:02] -So did we go over everything? Yes? -Yep. [00:40:35:12-00:40:38:19] -Back on Tuesday, right? -Yeah. [00:40:41:02-00:40:43:23] Ray, have fun at school. Wish me luck. [00:40:44:03-00:40:46:05] Luck! [00:41:05:14-00:41:08:20] -Hey, Rod. -Hey, Jerry-- [00:41:10:18-00:41:13:13] Cush, how are you, man? [00:41:13:16-00:41:16:13] Jerry, we should be selling these. [00:41:16:18-00:41:20:03] This is my agent, you might want his autograph. [00:41:20:13-00:41:22:02] My hand's getting tired. [00:41:22:06-00:41:25:04] -Excuse me. -What's happening? [00:41:25:13-00:41:27:04] Are you Hootie? [00:41:27:13-00:41:31:13] No, I am not Hootie. [00:41:36:19-00:41:39:22] What is it gonna be, San Diego or Denver? [00:41:40:06-00:41:42:00] I'll surf or ski. [00:41:46:02-00:41:48:14] He'll either surf or ski. [00:41:55:16-00:41:59:20] Rod, at last I find you. [00:42:00:00-00:42:04:01] Why am I here? It's like I'm five years late for the prom. [00:42:04:05-00:42:09:14] -Nobody gives a damn about me. -Let's walk through this lobby. [00:42:09:18-00:42:15:02] I want all the media and player reps to see you for what you are [00:42:15:06-00:42:18:07] The best-kept secret in the NFL. [00:42:19:15-00:42:24:15] The most commanding wide receiver. You're fast, fierce, charismatic. [00:42:24:19-00:42:27:15] You're the man. You are the man! Ready? [00:42:27:18-00:42:28:18] Let's go. [00:42:28:21-00:42:30:16] Let's walk. [00:42:31:18-00:42:34:20] The fiercest. You are the man. [00:42:35:00-00:42:39:08] -Let's do it. -Hi, Mel. Hi, Tom. [00:42:39:17-00:42:40:21] Where's Cush? [00:42:41:01-00:42:45:02] Good thing you held onto Cushman. San Diego or Denver? [00:42:45:06-00:42:50:19] I want you to meet Rod Tidwell, 110 catches, 1550 yards last year. [00:43:09:14-00:43:14:06] Now I wanna talk about Rod Tidwell. A fierce receiver. [00:43:25:00-00:43:28:16] I came all that way just to walk the lobby. [00:43:29:03-00:43:30:22] It might have even worked. [00:43:31:03-00:43:34:20] Yeah? Let's do that shit again. [00:43:36:20-00:43:41:06] Shooting a Reebok ad down there. Where are my endorsements? [00:43:41:15-00:43:45:22] I didn't get no love from Chevy, no love from Pepsi. [00:43:46:03-00:43:49:18] I didn't get no love from that Energizer Bunny or Nike. [00:43:49:23-00:43:52:18] Obviously, I didn't get love from Reebok. [00:43:52:22-00:43:57:05] -Did I tell you my Reebok story? -I gotta get back to Cush. [00:43:57:10-00:44:02:19] Oh, your golden paycheck. But wait, I'll boil it down for you. [00:44:02:23-00:44:04:18] Fuck Reebok! [00:44:04:23-00:44:07:19] All they do is ignore me. Always have. [00:44:08:00-00:44:09:21] Always have. [00:44:10:05-00:44:15:01] You know what was great down there? You unloaded that large chip... [00:44:15:05-00:44:16:23] ...on your shoulder. [00:44:17:04-00:44:19:17] And you let people in. [00:44:21:05-00:44:23:03] You were brilliant. [00:44:24:05-00:44:25:17] -Brilliant? -Brilliant. [00:44:25:22-00:44:29:07] -Really? -Take care, I'll see you tomorrow. [00:44:29:18-00:44:33:10] -You love me now? -I'm about showing you the money! [00:44:33:19-00:44:37:19] I was just testing you, but to hear you say that... [00:44:37:23-00:44:41:06] ...makes me love you, baby. You know? [00:44:41:10-00:44:43:18] Jerry, come back! [00:44:47:02-00:44:48:22] -How was your flight? -Good. [00:44:49:04-00:44:51:04] -What size are you? -12 and a half. [00:44:51:08-00:44:55:01] Grab a couple pairs of them new shoes by the door. [00:45:02:10-00:45:06:07] Cush, Matt, we have a decision to make. [00:45:07:19-00:45:12:07] San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario. It's big. [00:45:12:11-00:45:14:10] He's got to go number one. [00:45:14:19-00:45:19:10] San Diego wants to trade up with Denver. They want him bad. [00:45:19:19-00:45:24:02] -What about Denver? -This stuff happens before a draft. [00:45:24:06-00:45:25:20] San Diego, Matt... [00:45:26:01-00:45:30:17] ...they're offering seven years for 30. Signing bonus of 8. [00:45:30:21-00:45:34:10] -Should I unplug the phone? -Reporters keep calling. [00:45:34:19-00:45:38:03] You just be friendly and say, No comment. [00:45:39:02-00:45:42:03] I'm no good at talking and saying nothing. [00:45:43:22-00:45:46:03] Well, let me.... [00:45:46:07-00:45:50:08] For you, it's a pleasure. This is Cush. [00:45:51:22-00:45:55:12] It's Sugar. Is Maguire there? Sniff if he is. [00:45:55:20-00:45:59:07] Remember, you're in with the big boys now. [00:45:59:11-00:46:03:12] Let your dad talk, and know that I got you the deal. [00:46:03:21-00:46:07:07] This is business, not friendship. Be strong... [00:46:07:12-00:46:09:23] ...because you're global now. [00:46:10:03-00:46:14:02] Okay, buddy? See you later. [00:46:18:10-00:46:20:01] No comment. [00:46:27:00-00:46:29:21] -He's got it wrong. -You're on TV again. [00:46:30:02-00:46:32:21] I'm sick of me, already. [00:46:44:19-00:46:49:09] Before I go back to Denver, we should put something on paper. [00:46:49:14-00:46:52:05] Something that says you're with me. [00:46:52:10-00:46:54:23] Not right now, Jerry. [00:47:01:03-00:47:04:21] Do I know everything there is to know here, Matt? [00:47:08:05-00:47:11:10] You're not talking with Bob Sugar, are you? [00:47:12:03-00:47:15:22] Apparently, Denver would only deal with him. [00:47:16:14-00:47:19:12] Said who? Sugar? [00:47:20:11-00:47:22:01] I'm learning as I go. [00:47:22:12-00:47:27:20] So you empowered him to deal with Denver behind my back? [00:47:28:02-00:47:30:03] I'm sorry.... [00:47:31:22-00:47:35:00] -I love my son. -I love your son! [00:47:35:13-00:47:40:05] I brought Denver to 20 million. They always deal with me. [00:47:40:09-00:47:44:13] You listened to Sugar. Bob Sugar, Matt, is a child. [00:47:44:22-00:47:48:11] You let that snake in the door? [00:47:51:06-00:47:56:13] Listen, rookie mistake. I'll fix this Denver thing for you. [00:47:56:23-00:47:59:23] You didn't sign anything with Sugar, right? [00:48:02:07-00:48:06:16] Matt? Tell me you didn't sign. [00:48:07:21-00:48:10:11] Because I'm still sort of moved by your... [00:48:10:16-00:48:14:14] ...my word is stronger than oak thing. [00:48:16:09-00:48:19:06] We signed an hour ago. [00:48:20:03-00:48:24:01] You were in the lobby with the black fella. [00:48:26:23-00:48:30:11] Sorry, Jerry. I just want to play football. [00:48:33:11-00:48:38:04] -What do I do? How do I spin it? -Honey, it's spun. [00:48:38:09-00:48:40:16] What did I do to you? [00:48:41:02-00:48:42:22] It's all about you, isn't it? [00:48:43:02-00:48:48:03] Soothe me, save me, love me. I have to finish my job. [00:48:48:08-00:48:50:08] Everything's on the run. [00:48:50:13-00:48:54:04] You and I are sales people. We sell. [00:48:54:08-00:48:58:04] It's not Love me or Trust my handshake... [00:48:58:10-00:49:01:11] ...it's Make the sale! Get it signed. [00:49:01:15-00:49:04:08] Jump right into my nightmare. [00:49:04:12-00:49:07:01] So now I can't be honest? [00:49:07:05-00:49:12:06] -I'd prefer loyalty. -What'd we say when we got together? [00:49:12:10-00:49:14:08] Brutal truth. Remember? [00:49:15:06-00:49:17:16] I think you added the brutal. [00:49:18:01-00:49:23:09] There's a sensitivity thing that some people have. I don't have it. [00:49:23:13-00:49:26:16] I don't cry at movies, or gush over babies... [00:49:27:02-00:49:29:01] ...I don't do Christmas early... [00:49:29:06-00:49:32:18] ...and I don't tell a man who screwed up our lives [00:49:33:02-00:49:36:15] Oh, poor baby. That's me, for better or worse. [00:49:37:01-00:49:38:16] But I do love you. [00:49:42:17-00:49:46:06] -Avery, it's over. -I didn't hear it. [00:49:47:05-00:49:50:17] -Something is missing. -You've never been alone. [00:49:51:01-00:49:53:00] -Listen. -You can't be alone. [00:49:53:04-00:49:55:17] It's over. [00:49:58:16-00:50:01:14] No one has ever dumped me. [00:50:02:17-00:50:05:02] I'm not trying to make history. [00:50:05:18-00:50:09:10] I climbed to the top of El Capitan... [00:50:09:15-00:50:14:00] ...in 18 hours and 23 minutes. I can make this work. [00:50:17:00-00:50:18:16] No. [00:50:19:14-00:50:21:19] Oh, Jerry. [00:50:30:10-00:50:33:05] I didn't ever want to hurt you. [00:50:42:16-00:50:48:05] I won't let you hurt me, Jerry. I'm too strong for you. Loser! [00:50:53:12-00:50:56:18] Roll with the punches. Tomorrow's another day. [00:50:58:13-00:51:00:03] Taxi! [00:51:00:11-00:51:03:01] You're loving me now, aren't you? [00:51:03:15-00:51:06:09] Very much. Taxi! [00:51:06:14-00:51:10:03] Is it my imagination? Didn't we arrive in a limo? [00:51:10:07-00:51:15:15] The question is-- I hope I don't sound like a shrink here, but... [00:51:16:13-00:51:21:11] -...what's wrong? -Man, I'm just a big disappointment. [00:51:21:15-00:51:26:04] Jerry, everybody cries on this show. [00:51:26:11-00:51:29:04] If you tested positive, quit doing blow. [00:51:29:15-00:51:33:13] Upset about your baby? Why'd you leave her mother? [00:51:33:16-00:51:35:04] I knew her, she's okay. [00:51:35:08-00:51:40:10] The media don't understand the pressures $54 million comes with. [00:51:40:14-00:51:45:08] -This is some bullshit. -What are you doing with me, Rod? [00:51:45:21-00:51:51:05] -What? -Don't you even see? I'm finished. [00:51:51:14-00:51:54:07] I am fucked! [00:51:54:14-00:51:57:14] Twenty-four hours ago I was hot! [00:51:57:18-00:51:59:12] Now... [00:52:00:05-00:52:02:07] ...I'm a cautionary tale. [00:52:02:12-00:52:07:20] I don't need this jacket, because I'm cloaked in failure! [00:52:08:05-00:52:11:09] I lost him the night before the draft. [00:52:11:13-00:52:13:12] Why? Let's recap. [00:52:13:16-00:52:18:09] Because a hockey player's kid made me feel superficial. [00:52:18:13-00:52:22:15] I ate some bad pizza, went to bed and grew a conscience! [00:52:23:05-00:52:27:09] Well, boo-fucking-hoo! [00:52:29:15-00:52:32:04] I got a shelf life of 10 years. [00:52:32:08-00:52:37:13] My next contract has to bring the dollars that'll last a long time. [00:52:37:18-00:52:40:07] I'm done in five years. [00:52:40:12-00:52:42:19] What's my family gonna live on? [00:52:43:05-00:52:46:06] Huh? What you get me. [00:52:46:10-00:52:48:09] So I won't hear your shit. [00:52:48:14-00:52:53:12] Oh, I lost Cush and Avery.... [00:52:53:17-00:52:56:09] Could I have another drink, please? [00:52:56:14-00:52:59:14] Anybody else would have left you by now... [00:52:59:19-00:53:03:06] ...but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. [00:53:03:11-00:53:07:08] If I gotta ride your ass, you gonna show me the money. [00:53:07:17-00:53:09:21] You gonna show me the money. [00:53:12:13-00:53:16:23] We together on this. You know what I'm saying? We gonna be one. [00:53:18:22-00:53:21:18] The both of us! You know?! [00:53:21:22-00:53:24:10] Oh, my God. [00:53:28:14-00:53:31:11] You have no messages. [00:53:57:09-00:54:02:07] He's coming. He just lost his best client. I invited the guy over. [00:54:02:11-00:54:07:19] This is not a guy. It's a syndrome. Early midlife, hanging by a thread... [00:54:07:23-00:54:12:20] ...I can't be alone, I'll call my long-suffering assistant syndrome. [00:54:13:00-00:54:17:13] -But if that's what you want.... -Honey, he's engaged. [00:54:17:18-00:54:22:09] And for the first time, I'm part of something I believe in. [00:54:22:18-00:54:25:17] Okay. But he better not be good-looking! [00:54:31:22-00:54:33:16] I'm Jerry Maguire. [00:54:34:22-00:54:39:15] Hello. You're just the way I pictured you. [00:54:39:20-00:54:43:23] -I'm her disapproving sister, Laurel. -Honesty. [00:54:44:18-00:54:45:19] Thank you. [00:54:48:08-00:54:50:20] Thank you. Dorothy! [00:54:53:22-00:54:57:18] Dorothy, your boss is here. [00:54:58:09-00:54:59:15] Hello. [00:55:03:18-00:55:05:09] Hey, you. [00:55:05:13-00:55:08:02] -Thanks for inviting me over. -Sure. [00:55:08:11-00:55:11:21] Where's the little guy? [00:55:12:02-00:55:13:22] -He's sleeping. -Sleeping. [00:55:16:09-00:55:21:16] I'm so glad you're home. That alone thing is not my specialty. [00:55:22:15-00:55:23:16] Oh, my God! [00:55:28:13-00:55:31:01] Well, I broke up with Avery. [00:55:36:19-00:55:41:16] -Gosh, you know, that's too bad. -No, it's better... [00:55:41:21-00:55:46:14] ...because we'll still be friends. It's better now than later. [00:55:49:16-00:55:53:03] -I'm dying here, aren't I? -It's a really bad cut. [00:55:53:12-00:55:56:18] Just think if I got her the ring she really wanted. [00:56:02:20-00:56:05:01] Why don't you have a seat? [00:56:07:20-00:56:11:18] I'll get some aloe vera for the cut. [00:56:12:12-00:56:15:11] -Do you have something to drink? -Sure. [00:56:21:15-00:56:22:15] I heard. [00:56:22:20-00:56:26:23] No kidding. I saw the shadow of curious shoes under the door. [00:56:27:03-00:56:31:11] He'd go home with a gardening tool if it showed interest. [00:56:32:09-00:56:34:15] Use the frosted glasses. [00:56:34:21-00:56:36:15] -Thanks. -You're welcome. [00:56:36:19-00:56:40:19] -I warmed up some chicken. -That's the girl I love! [00:56:41:00-00:56:45:15] I'll only say this You've always been responsible with Ray. [00:56:45:21-00:56:49:14] He shouldn't hear a strange man's voice here. [00:56:49:18-00:56:53:17] -Some drunken stranger. -As opposed to 10 angry women? [00:56:55:11-00:56:58:10] Lean forward. Okay, I've got it. [00:56:58:15-00:57:01:12] It's still edible. Change your shirt. [00:57:08:10-00:57:09:22] Hi, Jerry. [00:57:11:17-00:57:16:17] Hi, Ray. Aren't you supposed to be in bed? [00:57:16:22-00:57:18:02] Yeah. [00:57:19:03-00:57:23:04] Don't worry, I won't tell. [00:57:24:03-00:57:27:17] The human head weighs eight pounds. [00:57:38:17-00:57:41:15] -Jerry Maguire. -I think it's this one. [00:57:44:02-00:57:48:22] You should dream about me. I should be on your mind constantly. [00:57:49:02-00:57:53:05] That's when the dollars will flow. The kwan will appear. [00:57:53:14-00:57:57:15] -Who is this? -Who is this? This is the Rod Tidwell. [00:57:57:19-00:58:00:00] I need to speak with my agent. [00:58:00:04-00:58:03:06] -We should be one. -You a football player? [00:58:03:20-00:58:08:02] A football player? I'm a teacher about to whomp your ass! [00:58:08:06-00:58:10:00] Put Jerry on the phone! [00:58:10:04-00:58:13:20] You just can't fall for some drowning man. [00:58:14:01-00:58:15:21] -Be practical. -Practical? [00:58:16:01-00:58:19:17] Turtleneck, sensible. V-neck, sexy. Turtleneck. [00:58:19:21-00:58:24:18] Don't say that. What are other women my age doing right now? [00:58:24:22-00:58:28:05] They're out partying, trying to get a man. [00:58:28:14-00:58:32:15] Trying to keep a man. Not me, I'm trying to raise a man. [00:58:32:22-00:58:38:06] This one. I've got a 24-hour-a-day reminder of Roger for my whole life. [00:58:38:15-00:58:43:00] -I've had three lovers in four years. -That's not bad. [00:58:43:04-00:58:47:22] All of them ran a distant second to a good book and a warm bath. [00:58:48:02-00:58:52:06] Look at me. I'm the oldest 26-year-old in the world. [00:58:52:16-00:58:54:18] -Now, how do I look? -Good. [00:58:55:06-00:58:56:18] Yeah? Thanks. [00:58:56:22-00:59:01:07] 72% of new buyers are African-American. That's what I am. [00:59:01:16-00:59:05:23] -You talk too much. -Talking is primitive communication. [00:59:06:03-00:59:09:15] -It was fun talking to you. Bye. -Jerry--! [00:59:10:13-00:59:14:02] -I'll make a ham sandwich. -I wanna say one thing. [00:59:14:06-00:59:18:13] -You do listen to me. -Well, I love you. Mayo? [00:59:18:18-00:59:21:13] --repression, as a religion. [00:59:21:17-00:59:25:19] When my daddy retired from the United Way after 38 years... [00:59:26:01-00:59:30:23] ...he said, I wish they'd given me a more comfortable chair. [00:59:31:04-00:59:32:21] And then my dad died. [00:59:33:02-00:59:37:14] My mom took me to the zoo, and I loved the zoo. And-- [00:59:37:18-00:59:38:20] Wait. [00:59:39:02-00:59:43:21] -I want to tell you more about my dad. -No, let's go to the zoo. [00:59:47:04-00:59:48:17] You're right. [00:59:48:23-00:59:53:05] It's just my whole life, I've been trying to talk. [00:59:53:16-00:59:56:00] I mean, really talk. [00:59:56:05-01:00:00:02] But no one wants to listen. You know that feeling? [01:00:00:06-01:00:04:11] -They just look at you-- -Let's go to the zoo, right now. [01:00:04:21-01:00:09:06] The zoo, you know-- The fucking zoo's closed. [01:00:12:05-01:00:14:06] You said fuck. [01:00:15:08-01:00:17:08] Yeah, I did. [01:00:17:23-01:00:20:04] -Is that--? -I won't tell. [01:00:23:03-01:00:28:02] Well, then I'm gonna have to take you to the zoo. [01:00:29:09-01:00:34:07] -I gotta go to bed, my mom's coming. -Oh, wait-- [01:00:35:17-01:00:38:08] I hear my mom. I gotta go to bed. [01:00:38:23-01:00:41:21] -Thanks for listening. -Sure. [01:00:43:19-01:00:48:06] Okay. Drinks, food, and I called you a cab. [01:00:50:21-01:00:54:18] -Good idea. -Quiet, I have a little boy asleep. [01:00:56:23-01:00:58:00] Right. [01:00:58:22-01:00:59:23] Our company. [01:01:04:04-01:01:09:03] Look. A little.... A little speech before I go. [01:01:14:09-01:01:19:06] Do not worry about your future. [01:01:19:18-01:01:24:16] You and your son, we, are just fine. [01:01:24:21-01:01:26:18] You still have a job. [01:01:27:05-01:01:32:06] But let me tell you something about Jerry Maguire, okay? [01:01:32:11-01:01:36:19] You come after me, and you will lose. [01:01:37:09-01:01:42:04] No, because I am a survivor. I'm a survivor! [01:01:42:21-01:01:48:05] Dorothy Boyd, you are with the Lord of the Living Room. [01:01:48:11-01:01:51:11] The King of the Kingdom! [01:01:51:20-01:01:54:00] And I am... [01:01:58:01-01:01:59:03] ...drunk. [01:02:08:19-01:02:11:23] We meet again. [01:02:24:23-01:02:26:00] Here. [01:02:36:02-01:02:37:12] Truth? [01:02:39:07-01:02:44:01] -Sure. -I care about the job, of course. [01:02:44:05-01:02:47:18] But mostly, I just want to be inspired. [01:02:49:20-01:02:53:06] -Me too. -What you wrote inspired me. [01:02:56:11-01:02:59:23] I'm working with you because of that memo. [01:03:01:20-01:03:03:12] I loved that memo. [01:03:07:10-01:03:09:11] It's a mission statement. [01:03:23:02-01:03:24:10] Well.... [01:03:25:03-01:03:27:22] Sorry about the hand. [01:03:31:21-01:03:34:11] You know that feeling? [01:03:34:21-01:03:38:10] You're not completely embarrassed yet... [01:03:38:20-01:03:41:23] ...but you glimpse tomorrow's embarrassment? [01:03:42:03-01:03:45:04] Don't worry about it, boss. [01:03:45:21-01:03:48:01] Oh, shit. You said boss. [01:03:48:05-01:03:51:13] -Yeah, I did. -Now I feel like Clarence Thomas. [01:03:51:22-01:03:56:08] -No, don't feel like Clarence Thomas. -I do. I feel like him. [01:03:56:12-01:04:01:07] -I'm, like, harassing you right now. -Well, I may not sue. [01:04:14:09-01:04:16:12] -Good evening. -Good evening. [01:04:19:13-01:04:22:13] Look, don't worry, okay? I mean, don't-- [01:04:24:22-01:04:28:13] We'll be okay because I am gonna take my one client... [01:04:30:04-01:04:32:23] ...and we are gonna go all the way. [01:04:34:12-01:04:38:05] Because, hey.... I'm back. [01:04:40:12-01:04:42:23] Don't worry. [01:04:58:05-01:05:02:11] -Way to go, Rod. Good catch. -You can't-- [01:05:03:22-01:05:05:23] All right, good job. [01:05:08:22-01:05:13:23] -Gotta talk about his contract, Dennis. -Meet me at The Crocodile, 800. [01:05:14:23-01:05:16:07] You bet. [01:05:36:07-01:05:37:18] Thank you. [01:05:37:22-01:05:41:12] Tell me you got lost. I thought I was your friend. [01:05:41:16-01:05:46:03] -Something came up. -Okay. $10 million for four years. [01:05:46:07-01:05:49:10] -You're dreaming. -Ten for four. It's a deal. [01:05:51:04-01:05:55:16] -He's got an attitude problem. -He listens to me. I can help you. [01:05:56:01-01:06:00:10] -He's a shrimp. -He broke all the records last year. [01:06:00:14-01:06:04:15] I want a prototypical wide receiver who's 6'3, 220. [01:06:05:01-01:06:08:05] Not some guy who's 5'10 and bitches. [01:06:08:09-01:06:11:16] Dennis, I'm asking you... [01:06:13:10-01:06:14:11] ...for a favor. [01:06:15:05-01:06:20:08] I introduced you to your wife. We've spent Christmases together. [01:06:20:12-01:06:24:15] -Holiday cheer. -Jerry, you're reaching. [01:06:25:00-01:06:29:12] I'm asking for a favor. Don't do this to me. We have history. [01:06:29:16-01:06:34:13] We got history, all right. You drove the prices up for years. [01:06:34:17-01:06:40:06] -It's your turn at the end of the line. -Dennis, don't-- [01:06:44:17-01:06:49:07] I talked with Dennis Wilburn about your renegotiation. [01:06:53:14-01:06:55:00] Talking? [01:06:55:09-01:07:00:17] Jerry Rice, Andre Reed, Chris Carter. I smoked all these fools! [01:07:01:19-01:07:04:13] Yet they're making the big sweet dollars. [01:07:04:18-01:07:09:12] They are making the kwan. And you're talking. [01:07:12:19-01:07:16:15] -Kwan? That's your word? -Hell yeah, that's my word. [01:07:16:19-01:07:20:18] Some dudes might have coin, but they'll never have kwan. [01:07:21:03-01:07:22:06] What is--? [01:07:22:10-01:07:27:18] It means love, respect, community and dollars. The entire package. [01:07:30:03-01:07:31:03] The kwan. [01:07:32:04-01:07:33:08] Great word. [01:07:35:09-01:07:38:08] -Towel? -No, I air-dry. [01:07:39:18-01:07:45:07] Listen, Rod. I say this with great respect for you. [01:07:46:13-01:07:50:08] But those players you mentioned are marquee players. [01:07:52:02-01:07:55:19] -And this deal where, you know, we-- -Marquee? [01:07:56:04-01:07:59:17] This is a renegotiation. We want more from them. [01:08:00:02-01:08:03:11] Show them your pure joy of the game. [01:08:03:15-01:08:06:12] Bury the attitude a bit, and show them-- [01:08:06:16-01:08:08:04] Wait. [01:08:08:13-01:08:12:08] -You're telling me to dance. -No. I'm saying... [01:08:13:02-01:08:16:21] ...to get back to the guy who first started playing. [01:08:17:05-01:08:22:04] Way back when you were a kid, it wasn't just about the money, was it? [01:08:22:21-01:08:24:15] Was it? [01:08:25:12-01:08:26:14] Was it? [01:08:28:18-01:08:32:09] Do your job. Don't you tell me to dance! [01:08:32:14-01:08:34:10] -Fine. -Hey. Hey! [01:08:34:14-01:08:36:08] I am an athlete. [01:08:36:14-01:08:38:21] -I am not an entertainer! -Fine! [01:08:39:06-01:08:44:14] I do not dance, and I do not start pre-season without a contract! [01:08:45:05-01:08:48:18] -Fine, fine, fine! -Jerry, talk to me. [01:08:49:21-01:08:52:17] Breathe! Breathe, Jerry. [01:08:55:07-01:08:57:15] I am out here for you. [01:08:58:11-01:09:01:13] You don't know what it's like to be me. [01:09:01:17-01:09:05:19] It is an up-at-dawn, pride-swallowing siege... [01:09:06:05-01:09:09:19] ...that I will never fully tell you about, okay?! [01:09:13:06-01:09:14:15] God. Help me! [01:09:15:17-01:09:18:18] Help me, Rod. Help me help you. [01:09:20:05-01:09:23:17] Help me help you. [01:09:24:11-01:09:27:10] Help me help you. [01:09:34:08-01:09:35:20] I'm sorry. [01:09:36:23-01:09:41:06] You are hanging on by a very thin thread. [01:09:42:06-01:09:44:08] And I dig that about you! [01:09:46:06-01:09:50:09] No contract? I'll help me, I'll help you, help everybody! [01:09:50:17-01:09:55:08] -That's my man. -Hey, I'm happy to entertain you. [01:09:55:12-01:09:57:17] Help me! Help me! [01:09:59:11-01:10:03:16] -See you in Los Angeles. -Jerry. Come on, man. [01:10:04:05-01:10:06:20] See, that's the difference between us. [01:10:07:05-01:10:10:20] You think we're fighting. I think we're talking. [01:10:15:15-01:10:19:17] Unless you love everybody, you can't sell anybody. [01:10:29:22-01:10:34:14] Dennis Wilburn is faxing his offer for Tidwell on Thursday morning. [01:10:34:18-01:10:38:15] -He said you'd be happy-- Glad. -He say happy or glad? [01:10:40:07-01:10:42:23] Glad. He said glad. Glad. [01:10:44:07-01:10:48:19] -Glad is good. -We could sure use that commission. [01:10:48:23-01:10:53:00] Here. I did a rundown on where you stand financially. [01:10:56:10-01:11:01:08] -My condo was devalued. -You don't have to explain. [01:11:01:21-01:11:05:13] The other night, I wanna apologize. [01:11:05:17-01:11:07:16] What happened there? [01:11:07:20-01:11:11:01] We're coworkers. We can't have atmosphere. [01:11:11:10-01:11:13:18] I'm very relieved you said that. [01:11:13:22-01:11:17:09] You know, the other night, I was lonely. [01:11:17:13-01:11:19:19] I felt you understood something. [01:11:20:19-01:11:23:16] We've got a company to think about. [01:11:23:20-01:11:26:21] I'll never take advantage of you again. [01:11:27:10-01:11:30:13] -Good. -You walked out on a job for me. [01:11:30:18-01:11:32:18] Can this be right? [01:11:33:18-01:11:34:21] Exactly. [01:11:36:09-01:11:40:09] I know you need to be alone with your thoughts. [01:11:40:12-01:11:43:14] Think about what's wrong and how to fix it. [01:11:43:19-01:11:46:12] And, you know, just be alone. [01:11:46:23-01:11:48:18] Alone. [01:11:54:19-01:11:58:12] -You wanna go out to dinner? -I know a great place. [01:11:58:16-01:12:03:01] I broke up with that loser, and then he started stalking me. [01:12:03:10-01:12:07:17] -What do you mean by stalking? -Coming over uninvited. [01:12:08:08-01:12:12:21] Coming over uninvited? So Romeo on your balcony is a stalker? [01:12:23:19-01:12:26:00] Excuse me. Ladies? [01:12:27:12-01:12:32:01] Good evening, I'm looking for Dorothy Boyd. [01:12:32:16-01:12:37:10] -She's in the kitchen. -Laurel. Hello. [01:12:38:16-01:12:43:01] -Where are you taking her tonight? -You're the nanny? [01:12:44:01-01:12:46:13] -Au pair. -Au pair? I see. [01:12:52:02-01:12:53:10] He likes you. [01:12:54:22-01:12:58:00] My goodness. I've got some gifts for you. [01:12:59:01-01:13:02:15] Do you like presents? Good, all right. [01:13:03:09-01:13:07:04] Arizona Cardinals. It's the team Rod plays for. [01:13:07:12-01:13:10:22] -Dropping your laundry off? -Want a Steelers hat? [01:13:11:02-01:13:13:17] -For me? -I got some things. [01:13:13:21-01:13:16:13] -I've got it in gray too. -Thanks. [01:13:16:17-01:13:20:11] You're very welcome. Look what I've got here. [01:13:20:15-01:13:23:21] An energy bar. It'll keep you up all night. [01:13:24:00-01:13:28:11] That's not a good idea. Aunt Laurel will eat that. [01:13:31:11-01:13:34:00] It looks like you've got a fan. [01:13:36:03-01:13:40:04] That's more than a dress, that's an Audrey Hepburn movie. [01:13:40:13-01:13:44:17] I got revved up at the thought of an evening among adults. [01:13:44:21-01:13:47:21] -No offense, buddy. -Jerry, you meet Chad? [01:13:48:01-01:13:51:12] Am I dressed okay? I didn't realize-- [01:13:55:18-01:13:58:01] Don't let him stay up too late. [01:13:58:05-01:14:02:19] Tonight, I'm gonna teach Ray about jazz. [01:14:02:23-01:14:05:03] That'll put him to sleep early. [01:14:06:22-01:14:08:19] I want to go too. [01:14:08:23-01:14:14:05] No, sweetheart, you stay here with Chad and be good. Kiss me. [01:14:15:05-01:14:16:20] Let's go. [01:14:19:04-01:14:20:21] -Good night. -Good night. [01:14:21:01-01:14:23:01] Give me a hug. [01:15:05:02-01:15:08:06] -I'll meet you at the car. -Okay. [01:15:08:15-01:15:10:15] You forgot your keys. [01:15:10:19-01:15:15:00] I've never seen him kiss a man just like a dad! [01:15:15:14-01:15:19:21] Wasn't that thrilling? He must have been needing that. [01:15:20:01-01:15:24:16] Don't cry at the start of a date. Cry at the end, like I do. [01:15:25:19-01:15:29:00] Don't be a shoulder for him to cry on either. [01:15:29:05-01:15:31:21] -Keys. -Oh, keys. [01:15:33:06-01:15:35:00] Oh, dear. [01:16:00:17-01:16:04:08] Ever since you've met me, I've been-- [01:16:09:06-01:16:13:19] It was laziness, my breakup with Avery. You know that saying? [01:16:13:23-01:16:18:17] It's nobody's fault. It's a lie. Somebody is always to blame. [01:16:18:21-01:16:22:21] You go for it like you do a job. You work at it. [01:16:23:01-01:16:27:05] But maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. [01:16:28:14-01:16:30:18] Yeah, maybe so. [01:16:31:20-01:16:36:19] But it's not every day you say goodbye to a woman like that. [01:16:39:00-01:16:42:05] -A song for the lovers? -No, thank you. [01:16:42:09-01:16:47:22] -No, no, we work together. -This is like an office meeting. [01:16:48:18-01:16:50:19] But I know what you mean. [01:16:51:06-01:16:56:19] It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was any good, even before.... [01:16:59:04-01:17:00:23] Before...? [01:17:02:22-01:17:05:05] -Jerry? -What? [01:17:06:03-01:17:09:05] Let's not tell our sad stories. [01:17:13:23-01:17:17:09] I'll be back in just a second, okay? [01:17:46:21-01:17:50:10] They sting. Let Chad catch the bee in the glass. [01:17:50:19-01:17:55:20] He won't hurt him. You've got such a good heart, buddy. I love you. [01:18:24:02-01:18:27:10] Well, this would be good night. [01:18:28:04-01:18:29:11] Good night. [01:18:30:10-01:18:33:07] I'll see you tomorrow. It's a big day. [01:18:59:19-01:19:00:20] Good night. [01:19:02:11-01:19:04:00] Good night. [01:19:36:03-01:19:48:18] Oops. [01:19:41:21-01:19:45:19] -Let me fix this. -Good idea. [01:20:40:05-01:20:42:22] I think you should not come in. [01:20:44:08-01:20:47:01] Or come in. [01:20:49:07-01:20:54:13] -Depending on how you feel. -The same to you. [01:20:56:23-01:20:59:03] I have to go in. [01:21:00:09-01:21:02:09] I live here. [01:21:10:09-01:21:11:22] Right. [01:21:16:11-01:21:18:03] I'll come in. [01:21:20:08-01:21:22:02] Good. [01:21:31:00-01:21:33:15] Are you sure we want to do this? [01:21:37:23-01:21:39:16] Oh, hell, yes. [01:21:49:10-01:21:52:16] -Did he have a good night? -Yeah, he's asleep. [01:21:53:01-01:21:57:03] -How did it go with sport-boy? -Still going. [01:21:58:13-01:22:00:15] All right. [01:22:05:15-01:22:07:07] How are you? [01:22:10:01-01:22:11:09] Treat her right. [01:22:16:00-01:22:17:20] She's great. [01:22:22:04-01:22:27:10] I know this might be a bit awkward, but I want you to use this. [01:22:28:04-01:22:30:03] No, look. God.... [01:22:31:16-01:22:36:13] This is Miles Davis and John Coltrane. [01:22:37:04-01:22:39:15] Stockholm 1963. [01:22:40:07-01:22:44:17] Two masters of freedom, playing before their art was corrupted... [01:22:45:01-01:22:47:23] ...by cocktail-lounge performers... [01:22:48:03-01:22:53:11] ...who destroyed the legacy of the only American art form [01:22:55:07-01:22:57:03] Jazz. [01:22:58:12-01:23:01:07] I've put some Mingus on there too. [01:23:09:00-01:23:14:04] -No barriers, no boundaries. -Chad, I got it. [01:23:47:09-01:23:48:18] Come here. [01:24:07:13-01:24:11:01] You know this is gonna change everything. [01:24:14:05-01:24:15:16] Promise? [01:24:21:19-01:24:24:13] What is this music? [01:24:58:14-01:25:02:10] I love getting up in the morning! I clap and say [01:25:02:14-01:25:04:15] This will be a great day! [01:25:07:07-01:25:11:05] Great! Did you really need to do this? [01:25:24:06-01:25:26:19] I'm getting him up, so don't worry. [01:25:27:07-01:25:30:18] What? I'm just waiting for coffee. I don't care. [01:25:31:11-01:25:34:05] -Just tell me one thing. -No. [01:25:37:14-01:25:38:18] -Why--? -I'm worried... [01:25:38:22-01:25:44:11] ...you'll believe in a guy who may not have an emotional marble in his head. [01:25:44:15-01:25:47:07] -Please, if I start talking.... -You please. [01:25:47:11-01:25:50:16] What am I for taking the opportunity? [01:25:50:20-01:25:56:07] -This guy's on the bottom rung. -Maybe I am taking advantage. [01:25:56:11-01:25:59:15] Does that make me a bad person? Huh? [01:25:59:18-01:26:05:07] I found someone popular and charming and not so nice to me, and he died. [01:26:05:13-01:26:07:16] Why should I let this guy go... [01:26:07:20-01:26:12:15] ...when everything in my body says that this one is the one? [01:26:12:18-01:26:15:21] Take it easy. I just wanted a few fun details. [01:26:17:06-01:26:19:07] Why didn't you say so? [01:26:19:16-01:26:23:22] Well, you might be interested in this one little detail. [01:26:24:07-01:26:26:16] I was just about to tell you... [01:26:28:09-01:26:30:16] ...that I love him. [01:26:31:21-01:26:36:10] I do! I love him, and I don't care what you think. [01:26:36:14-01:26:39:16] I love him for the man he wants to be... [01:26:39:21-01:26:43:05] ...and for the man that he almost is. [01:26:43:09-01:26:46:13] I love him, Laurel. I love him. [01:26:46:18-01:26:50:08] -I love him! -Hi, Jerry. [01:26:52:19-01:26:54:12] Act natural. [01:27:00:00-01:27:03:11] -Tell me he's not there. -He's not there. [01:27:03:16-01:27:05:12] Oh, God. [01:27:05:17-01:27:08:19] -Easy, ladies, easy. -Coffee? [01:27:09:22-01:27:13:23] No, thanks. We bottom-feeders prefer cereal first. [01:27:14:17-01:27:19:08] -Let's have Apple Jacks. -Apple Jacks it is. [01:27:21:19-01:27:23:15] Good morning, darling. [01:27:26:11-01:27:27:14] Morning. [01:27:28:00-01:27:30:12] -What's going on? -A lot, actually. [01:27:30:17-01:27:34:13] We've got a big fax today. We need this commission. [01:27:34:20-01:27:36:22] Need this commission. Milk? [01:27:39:09-01:27:40:21] Cheers. [01:27:48:00-01:27:51:06] That was really great of you this morning. [01:27:52:08-01:27:57:08] Let's just root for a big offer so we can move out of this room... [01:27:57:13-01:27:59:21] ...into a real office. [01:28:00:01-01:28:02:19] Would you mind? Thanks a lot. [01:28:11:08-01:28:12:20] Shit. [01:28:18:18-01:28:22:21] 1.7 for three years? Man, we owe more than that! [01:28:23:01-01:28:25:23] This is the game. I'll get back to them. [01:28:26:09-01:28:29:23] And say what? Please remove your dick from my ass? [01:28:30:09-01:28:33:15] I'm sorry, I'm just a little pregnant right now. [01:28:33:19-01:28:38:21] -I feel like crying. -Let's not take this emotionally. [01:28:39:01-01:28:43:10] -We'll roll with the problem. -Why are you so calm? [01:28:43:14-01:28:47:08] Roll with this problem? Don't take it emotionally? [01:28:47:12-01:28:50:19] You haven't gotten emotional enough over him! [01:28:50:22-01:28:53:16] -Get me Bob Sugar on the phone. -Marcee.... [01:28:56:19-01:29:01:14] -You wanna leave me? -A lot of agents say a lot of shit. [01:29:01:19-01:29:03:19] What do you stand for?! [01:29:03:23-01:29:09:03] How about integrity? There's so much greed in the world... [01:29:09:11-01:29:12:11] ...I don't know what to tell my son! [01:29:12:15-01:29:15:21] This guy isn't yelling, Show me the money! [01:29:16:01-01:29:21:01] Do you know he's broke and working for you for free? [01:29:22:02-01:29:25:12] Broke! Broke, broke, broke. [01:29:26:00-01:29:30:15] -I'm not as good at insults as she is. -That was pretty good. [01:29:30:20-01:29:32:18] No shit. [01:29:33:23-01:29:36:13] Let me show you something. [01:29:40:00-01:29:44:20] -Here. Rod, read this. -No, no, no, no. [01:29:45:11-01:29:49:03] I just think that-- I think it's important. [01:29:49:16-01:29:51:20] I appreciate this, but.... [01:29:52:00-01:29:55:13] You should be proud. They should read it. [01:29:56:02-01:30:01:12] Tell me what to do. Tell me to eat lima beans, I'll eat lima beans. [01:30:02:14-01:30:05:13] You say this is the best, all we can get-- [01:30:05:17-01:30:09:00] -All we can get? -I'm talking with my agent. [01:30:09:04-01:30:14:17] This is what you're gonna do. You're gonna reject that shitty contract. [01:30:15:02-01:30:20:15] Play out your existing shitty contract, and next year, you're a free agent. [01:30:21:12-01:30:26:18] Baby, this is us. You and me. We determine our worth. [01:30:27:00-01:30:29:10] You are a strong, proud... [01:30:29:14-01:30:33:03] ...surviving, splendid black man. [01:30:35:19-01:30:37:03] Marcee... [01:30:38:10-01:30:40:14] ...you are the shit. [01:30:43:17-01:30:45:14] Oh, baby. [01:30:48:00-01:30:53:03] -If you get injured, you get zero. -Won't happen. I'm strong in mind. [01:30:56:16-01:31:01:13] -It's a risk. -You bet on me, like I bet on you. [01:31:07:18-01:31:10:18] You know? My man! [01:31:14:05-01:31:16:13] You know, baby? [01:31:17:23-01:31:21:19] -You're so crazy. -I love you, baby. [01:31:23:02-01:31:25:23] -Let me kiss that head. -Thank you. [01:31:34:18-01:31:39:05] -I'm taking that job in San Diego. -Don't talk about that yet. [01:31:39:17-01:31:45:01] -You can't afford me. -I'll find something fast for Tidwell. [01:31:45:12-01:31:49:03] -I refuse to be a drain. -We'll stay afloat. [01:31:49:12-01:31:53:21] We'll stay afloat. Don't leave. [01:31:54:01-01:31:57:21] -Get on the camel. -You've been on my ass all day. [01:31:58:01-01:32:01:00] -He's my client. -Get him on the camel. [01:32:01:01-01:32:03:20] -I will. -We don't need a camel. [01:32:04:00-01:32:08:07] -It's Camel Chevrolet. -You see that? That's how I feel. [01:32:08:16-01:32:11:16] -He's feeling my pain! -Get on the camel! [01:32:11:20-01:32:16:18] -I'm pulling him from this. -It's okay. Just get rid of the camel. [01:32:16:22-01:32:20:16] -This isn't what I had in mind. -You're pulling him? [01:32:20:20-01:32:22:18] Right, let's bounce. [01:32:23:16-01:32:27:23] Pulling him? Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him. [01:32:28:20-01:32:33:04] I know you needed that commission, but we won't get Reebok... [01:32:33:08-01:32:36:04] ...with no regional Camel ad. Excuse me. [01:32:36:15-01:32:41:17] -Can I ask you a personal question? -Are we gonna be friends now? [01:32:41:22-01:32:44:07] What do you know about single moms? [01:32:44:15-01:32:46:21] I was raised by one. [01:32:47:01-01:32:52:14] Tell me. Because after this, she'll have to take that job in San Diego. [01:32:52:18-01:32:56:23] First of all, single mothers don't date. Watch yourself. [01:32:57:03-01:33:01:18] They've been to the circus. You know what I mean? [01:33:01:22-01:33:05:18] They've been to the puppet show and seen the strings. [01:33:05:22-01:33:08:08] -You love her? -How do I know? [01:33:08:17-01:33:10:21] You know when you know. [01:33:11:01-01:33:15:20] I don't want her to go. I've been hanging out at her place a lot. [01:33:16:00-01:33:19:23] That right there is bullshit! You gotta be fair to her. [01:33:20:03-01:33:24:23] Single mothers are a sacred thing. You gotta have the talk. [01:33:26:14-01:33:31:15] She loves you. If you don't love her, you have got to tell her. [01:33:34:09-01:33:38:04] The kid's amazing. He.... [01:33:40:16-01:33:43:04] I feel you. I feel you, dog. [01:33:43:08-01:33:48:00] But a real man wouldn't shoplift the pootie from a single mother. [01:33:49:02-01:33:52:05] I didn't shoplift the pootie. [01:33:57:17-01:34:02:00] All right. I shoplifted the pootie. [01:34:10:21-01:34:15:20] You know, John Coltrane once said to Miles Davis.... [01:34:16:08-01:34:21:10] When you say goodbye to him, just be cool. What's meant to be will be. [01:34:21:19-01:34:27:01] You'll see each other. I'm losing the only person who listens to me. [01:34:27:05-01:34:30:22] -Quit making me laugh. -You're doing the right thing. [01:34:31:03-01:34:34:16] Start your life. Don't cushion the fall for him. [01:34:34:20-01:34:38:01] Check out Exhibit A on the front lawn. [01:34:39:20-01:34:43:09] -I'm almost sympathetic to the guy. -Goodbye. [01:34:43:18-01:34:45:11] All right. Goodbye. [01:34:48:11-01:34:50:04] Bye. [01:34:57:01-01:35:00:20] Listen, you're gonna like it in San Diego. [01:35:05:06-01:35:09:11] It's gonna be great there. You'll make a lot of friends. [01:35:10:09-01:35:14:23] -I'm gonna see you this weekend. -Go ahead and go. [01:35:20:07-01:35:22:19] Go ahead and go. [01:35:33:11-01:35:37:19] -Sure you're okay to drive this? -This rig? No problem. [01:35:37:22-01:35:42:23] -I'll see you this weekend. -Get in the car. Get in the car. [01:35:43:03-01:35:47:21] I'll see you in a couple of days, and I love you. [01:35:49:03-01:35:51:05] I love you too. [01:35:52:23-01:35:54:20] -What? -Nothing. [01:35:55:05-01:35:57:06] I'll see you soon. [01:35:58:05-01:36:02:21] Look, if this weekend should turn into next month... [01:36:03:01-01:36:08:08] ...and next month turns into whenever, don't make a joke of your life. [01:36:08:12-01:36:11:20] Go back and read what you wrote. [01:36:11:23-01:36:17:18] You're better than the Bob Sugars. Don't forget that. [01:36:34:13-01:36:38:07] -Wait! Wait a second. -No, no! Oh, God. [01:36:40:06-01:36:45:02] -We can save on medical, rent.... -Don't listen to him. [01:36:45:06-01:36:49:01] What if we stay together? What if we got married? [01:36:50:07-01:36:55:21] -If I said that, would you stay? -Don't do that. Don't say that unless-- [01:36:56:01-01:36:59:05] Well, say it if you want to. [01:37:04:13-01:37:06:03] Will you marry me? [01:37:12:11-01:37:14:05] What are you thinking? [01:37:49:00-01:37:51:04] We're getting married. [01:37:52:05-01:37:57:02] Do you, Jerry Maguire, take this woman to be your wife? [01:37:57:10-01:37:58:11] Not yet. [01:37:58:15-01:38:04:03] And do you, Dorothy Boyd, take this man to be your husband? [01:38:05:07-01:38:06:09] Almost. [01:38:06:13-01:38:09:04] I now pronounce you husband and wife. [01:38:09:09-01:38:11:23] -Okay, sweetie. -Oh, yeah. [01:38:50:22-01:38:52:15] I should go. [01:38:55:05-01:38:58:12] Come on, brother. Talk to me, brother. [01:39:12:04-01:39:14:01] We did it. [01:39:15:10-01:39:17:04] We sure did. [01:39:36:16-01:39:39:13] You fuck this up, I'll kill you. [01:39:45:18-01:39:48:05] I'm glad we had this talk. [01:39:50:08-01:39:52:11] Oh, look at them. [01:39:55:05-01:39:58:01] She is so beautiful. [01:40:13:18-01:40:17:05] I do not believe they have this on tape. [01:40:18:11-01:40:20:16] Hey, that's my bro. [01:40:24:00-01:40:27:13] See, now I'm gonna release this to ESPN. [01:40:29:10-01:40:34:15] -You think I'm joking. -No, it's okay. I know where you live. [01:40:37:10-01:40:40:08] You didn't have the talk, did you? [01:40:43:04-01:40:44:07] No. [01:40:45:15-01:40:48:19] Well, this definitely was another way to go. [01:40:50:10-01:40:53:16] Hey, Dorothy, come here. [01:40:54:01-01:40:57:14] Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. and Mrs. Maguire. [01:40:58:07-01:41:01:01] We're gonna have a great season! [01:41:09:16-01:41:12:05] Scotty, Tidwell did four for 36. [01:41:15:09-01:41:17:06] -Jerry. -Dennis. [01:41:17:11-01:41:19:18] -He's having a good game. So far. -He is. [01:41:20:07-01:41:22:11] You're gonna miss him next year. [01:41:22:15-01:41:25:14] Loser. [01:41:28:04-01:41:31:20] I've got a great team behind me and I'm loving it. [01:41:38:16-01:41:40:10] That's my mo'fo! [01:41:41:19-01:41:42:20] Come here. [01:41:44:23-01:41:49:19] Why don't you be the first man in your family not to use that word? [01:41:50:05-01:41:54:05] And we'll let you live. Now go kiss Daddy, quick. [01:41:57:06-01:41:58:07] Come on, now! [01:41:59:07-01:42:01:11] Come on, Rod! [01:42:04:15-01:42:07:15] I saw you limping after the first quarter. [01:42:07:19-01:42:09:14] Yeah, I-- [01:42:12:03-01:42:16:03] I sprained my ankle on the ice out there. It was cold. [01:42:16:07-01:42:17:17] All right. Thanks. [01:42:17:21-01:42:22:15] That went well. Anybody else worth talking to? No. [01:42:22:19-01:42:24:15] Let's get out of here. [01:42:26:06-01:42:28:21] -How's your head? -Bubblicious. [01:42:30:08-01:42:32:11] -How are you? -Hey, Rod. [01:42:32:15-01:42:35:17] -How you doing, man? -Hanging in there. [01:42:39:06-01:42:43:13] That quarterback sucks. He's gonna get me killed. [01:42:43:17-01:42:47:07] He's throwing high and across the middle. [01:42:47:11-01:42:51:07] My brain's blown because you weren't asshole enough... [01:42:51:11-01:42:54:15] ...to get me my 10 million three months ago. [01:42:56:21-01:43:01:12] Take care of yourself on that field. You're my entire client roster. [01:43:01:16-01:43:05:20] Don't I know this. Now go home to your wife. [01:43:06:06-01:43:09:04] -What's that mean? -What are you doing here? [01:43:09:08-01:43:13:18] -You could've told me on the phone. -How about personal attention? [01:43:13:22-01:43:17:11] -You don't want to go home. -What are you saying? [01:43:17:16-01:43:21:22] I'm just trying to talk to you. How's your marriage? [01:43:22:07-01:43:25:08] The husband and wife thing, how is that? [01:43:32:16-01:43:37:10] -Not everyone has what you have. -Why did you get married? [01:43:38:07-01:43:42:07] -I'm just asking as a friend. -You want an answer? [01:43:42:12-01:43:43:23] Loyalty. [01:43:45:05-01:43:46:17] She was loyal. [01:43:51:09-01:43:55:17] I mean, you know, everything grew from there. [01:43:56:06-01:43:57:23] It just... [01:43:59:00-01:44:00:17] ...grew from there. [01:44:01:22-01:44:06:06] -That's an answer. -That's the answer. [01:44:06:11-01:44:11:07] It's not sexy. Shit! But that's an answer. [01:44:11:11-01:44:15:21] Tell him what he's won, Bob. A beautiful marriage! [01:44:16:09-01:44:17:21] Shit! [01:44:18:08-01:44:22:23] Well, I'm happy to entertain you, as always, Rod. [01:44:26:10-01:44:28:13] I have a question for you. [01:44:28:17-01:44:30:18] -Are we really friends? -Why not? [01:44:31:00-01:44:35:22] Friends can tell each other anything if we have our friends hats on, right? [01:44:36:06-01:44:37:19] -I think so. -All right. [01:44:39:00-01:44:42:08] Here's why you don't have your $10 million. [01:44:42:11-01:44:47:09] You're a paycheck player. You play with your head, not your heart. [01:44:47:13-01:44:49:19] In your personal life? Heart. [01:44:49:23-01:44:53:11] On the field, it's about what you didn't get. [01:44:53:18-01:44:55:23] Who's to blame, who underthrew... [01:44:56:09-01:45:00:12] ...who has the contract you don't, who's not giving you love! [01:45:00:16-01:45:05:16] That is not what inspires people! That is not what inspires people! [01:45:05:20-01:45:09:21] Just shut up! Play the game from your heart. [01:45:10:01-01:45:14:11] Then I'll show you the kwan. And that's the truth! [01:45:14:15-01:45:19:14] Can you handle it? It's just a question from a friend. You know? [01:45:21:19-01:45:25:12] When they call you shrimp, I'm the one who defends you! [01:45:25:17-01:45:28:13] -I don't wanna be friends no more. -Fine. [01:45:28:17-01:45:32:01] Quit using that word kwan. That's my word! [01:45:32:10-01:45:34:23] -I'll see you in L.A. -No heart?! [01:45:36:02-01:45:38:22] I'm all heart, motherfucker! [01:46:16:17-01:46:21:12] -How many concussions has he had? -I can't get no respect. [01:46:21:16-01:46:23:15] I'm making miracles happen. [01:46:41:23-01:46:46:11] I went to see this so-called black film the other day. [01:46:46:19-01:46:50:00] No more salt. Your biggest game is coming up. [01:46:50:04-01:46:53:23] I don't want you dehydrated for Monday Night Football. [01:46:56:02-01:47:01:12] Twenty minutes of coming attractions. All black films, all violent. [01:47:01:16-01:47:06:20] -Brothers shooting brothers. -I hate you seeing movies alone. [01:47:07:00-01:47:11:10] -Baby. -My Pisces queen. [01:47:13:21-01:47:16:12] I hate seeing movies without you. [01:47:19:10-01:47:22:02] I won't do it anymore, okay? [01:47:31:15-01:47:34:00] -Baby. -Baby! [01:47:37:02-01:47:39:19] -Now? -Baby now! [01:47:41:13-01:47:45:13] -Ray, it's time to go. -You got them? [01:47:45:16-01:47:48:13] Do you take Visa? Take it! [01:47:49:20-01:47:52:01] What were you thinking tonight... [01:47:52:05-01:47:57:04] ...watching them go through the entire human emotional experience? [01:47:57:14-01:48:00:13] I hope he doesn't get injured. [01:48:02:17-01:48:04:13] I felt responsible. [01:48:06:02-01:48:10:19] Sometimes I can't tell at all what's going on in your head. [01:48:16:21-01:48:20:02] And I don't know your noises yet. [01:48:20:23-01:48:26:12] -Well, when you wonder, ask me. -Okay, I will. [01:48:27:18-01:48:29:23] I thought I just did. [01:48:35:03-01:48:37:23] -Why do you love me? -Why do you love me? [01:48:39:05-01:48:41:02] Can I come and watch TV? [01:48:41:14-01:48:44:02] -In just a minute. -For a few minutes. [01:49:03:14-01:49:05:16] Hang in there. He's not going anywhere. [01:49:06:04-01:49:07:18] I know. [01:49:08:07-01:49:12:01] -Can we talk about something else? -I don't think so. [01:49:12:05-01:49:17:05] I'm incapable of small talk. But that's why you love me, right? [01:49:30:18-01:49:34:04] I'm about personal attention. This is my life. [01:49:34:14-01:49:37:03] I'm available to you 24 hours a day. [01:49:37:07-01:49:41:07] I'll be in Phoenix tomorrow for Monday Night Football. [01:49:41:15-01:49:45:02] I can be in Indiana by 1130 Tuesday morning. [01:49:45:06-01:49:47:06] Just give me 20 minutes. [01:49:47:23-01:49:50:21] I'm not asking for an answer now. [01:49:51:01-01:49:55:05] I'll call you tomorrow. Just enjoy your day. Tell Doug hi. [01:49:55:19-01:49:59:15] All right, thank you. Same to you, Marilee. [01:50:02:07-01:50:06:02] Indiana, Tuesday. I'll be there. [01:50:10:06-01:50:11:16] It's my fault. [01:50:14:04-01:50:15:08] What? [01:50:15:17-01:50:18:16] It's not fair to you, this whole thing. [01:50:22:06-01:50:23:16] Come here. [01:50:24:21-01:50:27:20] Tell me. Let me help. [01:50:28:05-01:50:32:02] I took advantage of you. Worst of all, I'm not alone. [01:50:32:06-01:50:34:21] I did this with a kid. [01:50:35:02-01:50:40:04] I was just on some wild ride where I thought that... [01:50:40:09-01:50:45:03] ...I was in love enough for both of us. [01:50:46:07-01:50:49:03] I pretended your proposal was real... [01:50:49:07-01:50:52:17] ...when it might have been a hypothetical. [01:50:55:04-01:50:57:04] I did this. [01:50:57:17-01:51:00:23] At least I can do something about it now. [01:51:01:21-01:51:04:10] I'm not a guy who runs. [01:51:04:20-01:51:06:16] I stick. [01:51:08:18-01:51:11:20] Well, I don't need you to stick. [01:51:12:07-01:51:15:09] What do you want? My soul or something? [01:51:15:18-01:51:21:02] -Why not? I deserve that. -What if I'm not built that way? [01:51:23:09-01:51:27:08] -I think we made a mistake. -What if it's true? [01:51:29:20-01:51:33:02] Great at friendship, bad at intimacy. [01:51:33:06-01:51:37:05] It's the theme of my bachelor film, for God's sake. [01:51:37:09-01:51:42:06] I know, I watched it. I sort of know it by heart. [01:51:45:19-01:51:49:02] -I don't like to give up. -Please. [01:51:50:19-01:51:55:20] My need to make the best of things, and your need to be responsible.... [01:51:56:00-01:52:00:20] If we don't say something about it now, we could lose 10 years... [01:52:01:00-01:52:02:22] ...being polite. [01:52:04:22-01:52:09:16] Let's just call this next road trip what it really is [01:52:10:20-01:52:13:02] A nice long break. [01:52:21:10-01:52:23:06] What about Ray? [01:52:27:05-01:52:29:20] Well, you'll be friends. [01:52:30:23-01:52:32:10] Friends? [01:52:37:02-01:52:41:10] -Of course you'll be friends. -I'll take him to the zoo. [01:52:45:20-01:52:48:21] So this break is a breakup? That's-- [01:52:49:01-01:52:53:11] Come on, Jerry. You know this isn't easy for me. [01:52:54:10-01:52:57:06] On the surface, everything looks fine. [01:52:58:04-01:53:01:06] I've got this great guy. [01:53:02:03-01:53:05:01] And he loves my kid. [01:53:07:08-01:53:10:06] And he sure does like me a lot. [01:53:16:21-01:53:19:13] And I can't live like that. [01:53:22:13-01:53:25:10] It's not how I'm built. [01:53:58:02-01:54:02:22] If this is empty, this doesn't matter. [01:54:24:23-01:54:27:09] It was just a mission statement. [01:54:43:09-01:54:45:11] Put your arms up, please. [01:54:59:11-01:55:03:13] Hey, buddy. I wondered where you were. How's it going? [01:55:03:23-01:55:05:16] Get out of here. Go. [01:55:08:10-01:55:11:22] -Where's your agent? -I don't know. [01:55:12:09-01:55:17:03] You belong with the big boys. You belong with the big money. [01:55:17:07-01:55:21:15] -You're fucking Rod Tidwell! -Get away from my guy. [01:55:22:00-01:55:26:02] -I was just telling-- -Just go. Flee. [01:55:26:06-01:55:30:13] This is a nice moment for you. I'm gonna let you have it. [01:55:32:15-01:55:35:16] Give me a call, Rod. Say hi to Marcee. [01:55:43:11-01:55:46:08] -Thanks for coming. -I missed you. [01:55:49:01-01:55:52:15] What can I say? You're all I've got. [01:55:55:01-01:56:00:10] Frank Gifford with Al Michaels and Dan Dierdorf at the Sun Devil Stadium. [01:56:00:14-01:56:05:05] The story is the Cardinals are still alive for a playoff spot. [01:56:05:10-01:56:10:05] The reason for that is the outstanding play of Rod Tidwell. [01:56:10:09-01:56:12:10] We'll talk about that too. [01:56:12:14-01:56:16:07] The Dallas Cowboys know they're in the playoffs. [01:56:16:11-01:56:19:17] Going for a consecutive Super Bowl. [01:56:20:01-01:56:23:07] If Arizona wins tonight and next week... [01:56:23:11-01:56:29:00] ...they'll make the playoffs for the first time in 21 years. [01:56:29:14-01:56:33:08] Better not mess up for Monday Night Football. [01:56:33:18-01:56:38:03] What did I say? He's always nervous for televised games. [01:56:38:07-01:56:43:03] The Cowboys continue their mission on Monday Night Football. [01:56:50:14-01:56:53:02] -Hey, Shannon. -Hi, good game. [01:56:53:06-01:56:56:07] -Great column this morning. -Thanks. [01:57:01:16-01:57:03:04] Fuck you, punk! [01:57:10:09-01:57:12:16] It's a real bruiser out there. [01:57:13:01-01:57:17:06] The Cardinals refuse to go quietly into the desert night... [01:57:17:10-01:57:22:06] ...as the interminable season winds down. Just trying to be poetic. [01:57:22:10-01:57:24:10] Wax on, Al. Wax on. [01:57:26:13-01:57:28:13] A tough hit on Tidwell. [01:57:28:17-01:57:30:06] Nothing poetic about that. [01:57:30:09-01:57:34:20] -I'd have made that a touchdown. -That's his sixth catch tonight. [01:57:35:04-01:57:38:01] Split to the right. Swenson looks. [01:57:38:05-01:57:40:16] A first down at the 19-yard line. [01:57:41:01-01:57:46:09] Another savage hit across the middle on Rod Tidwell. [01:57:46:13-01:57:49:06] They're working Tidwell, aren't they? [01:57:49:10-01:57:54:07] -What does Daddy always say? -It looks worse than it really is. [01:57:55:03-01:57:57:13] He's gonna kill himself. [01:57:57:16-01:57:59:15] -Be quiet. -What did I say? [01:57:59:19-01:58:03:07] Two minutes to play. Dallas leading by three. [01:58:03:11-01:58:07:20] Second down and one now at the Dallas 11-yard line. [01:58:08:05-01:58:11:14] Swenson backs to pass. A blitz! [01:58:11:18-01:58:14:17] Down he goes! Sacked for a six-yard loss. [01:58:14:21-01:58:18:06] Good move coming with a blitz after Swenson. [01:58:18:10-01:58:23:06] He had too many men in that pattern. They couldn't pick up the blitz. [01:58:25:05-01:58:28:07] 90 razor, X-out on one, ready? [01:58:29:19-01:58:31:15] Here we go! [01:58:31:19-01:58:34:18] He had a chance to get rid of it. [01:58:35:03-01:58:38:09] They've now gone to third and seven. [01:58:38:14-01:58:43:14] In the waning moments of this game, Dallas 17, Arizona 14. [01:58:44:04-01:58:47:20] Tidwell in motion. Moving back to his left now. [01:58:48:05-01:58:53:03] Play fake. Swenson, protected well, lofts one into the end zone. [01:58:53:07-01:58:55:17] Tidwell! Touchdown, Cardinals! [01:58:55:21-01:58:59:16] -Did you see him go up on that ball? -He held onto it. [01:58:59:20-01:59:04:13] He's still down. Tidwell, upside down, hits the ground hard. [01:59:04:17-01:59:09:07] -He maintains control of the football. -He's hurt too. [01:59:09:11-01:59:11:05] He's not getting up. [01:59:11:08-01:59:16:07] -Concerned look on the players' faces. -Get up, baby. [01:59:17:13-01:59:20:21] The trainer out. It's Tidwell's ninth catch. [01:59:21:06-01:59:24:17] -Oh, my God. -He gives Arizona the lead. [01:59:32:20-01:59:36:19] -Can you hear me? -Blink! Come on, blink! [01:59:44:10-01:59:48:00] Commercial! Show me what's wrong with my husband. [01:59:48:06-01:59:51:08] -I said he was too small for the NFL. -Shut up. [01:59:51:12-01:59:56:09] -It's the truth. I'm keeping it real! -Tee Pee, shut up! [01:59:56:13-02:00:01:20] Can't you be loyal to your brother? Get the hell out of my house! [02:00:02:14-02:00:05:22] Hello? Hold on. It's Jerry Maguire. [02:00:06:22-02:00:08:10] Punk! [02:00:10:16-02:00:13:22] Jerry? Oh, my God, I am freaking out. [02:00:14:07-02:00:16:17] Marcee, he's unconscious. [02:00:16:21-02:00:21:16] Just stay calm. Keep the lines open, I will call you back. [02:00:21:20-02:00:24:13] There are good doctors. Stay calm. [02:00:24:17-02:00:28:13] You have to tell me something. I am freaking here. [02:00:28:17-02:00:33:10] We gotta stay calm. Your family needs you to stay calm. [02:00:33:20-02:00:37:19] I know, but my whole life is this family... [02:00:37:23-02:00:41:00] ...and it does not work without him! [02:00:41:18-02:00:46:07] All eyes at Sun Devil Stadium are focused on Rod Tidwell. [02:00:46:11-02:00:50:08] I am so sorry about everything I said about your job. [02:00:50:12-02:00:54:08] Just do whatever you can to get Rod to me, please. [02:00:54:12-02:00:58:17] Just do whatever you can. Please, Jerry. [02:00:59:08-02:01:04:08] At a time like this, you just hope his family is not watching this. [02:01:05:10-02:01:08:15] It could be his neck. It could be his back. [02:01:12:15-02:01:15:18] Blink, baby! Come on, wake up! [02:01:17:18-02:01:19:23] We love you, Rod! [02:01:29:18-02:01:31:18] Can you hear me? [02:01:32:11-02:01:34:00] Can you hear me? [02:01:34:09-02:01:36:18] Do you know where you are? [02:01:36:22-02:01:39:22] The trainer's still trying to revive him. [02:01:40:07-02:01:42:13] We'd love to see some movement. [02:01:42:18-02:01:45:23] -Rod? -Let's get him off the field. [02:01:46:09-02:01:49:10] -No. -Get the gurney. Get him off the field. [02:01:49:14-02:01:54:09] Wait, wait. Just let me enjoy this for a minute. [02:01:54:13-02:01:58:20] We're looking for some movement. Is that his head coming up? [02:01:59:15-02:02:01:16] He's trying to get up. [02:02:03:11-02:02:04:21] He is getting up. [02:02:13:13-02:02:16:14] Look at him! Oh, Mommy, he's okay. [02:02:20:14-02:02:23:12] The whole stadium is standing. [02:02:23:16-02:02:26:10] He's up on his feet and the crowd loves it. [02:02:54:18-02:03:00:02] Here's a guy who's normally very truculent with the media, aloof.... [02:03:15:15-02:03:19:01] -We're happy for you. -He'll get a flag on this. [02:03:19:11-02:03:21:02] Who cares! [02:03:36:15-02:03:39:17] -Congratulations. -Thank you. Helluva game. [02:03:40:19-02:03:42:16] -Congratulations. -Thanks. [02:03:50:18-02:03:53:00] You are gonna pay. [02:03:53:04-02:03:55:22] I know. I know. [02:04:15:20-02:04:17:20] Where's Jerry? [02:04:37:18-02:04:39:20] You did it. [02:04:40:00-02:04:41:16] You did. [02:04:43:06-02:04:46:13] Why don't we have that kind of relationship? [02:04:55:06-02:04:57:17] Is that your porty or mine? [02:05:00:21-02:05:02:13] Dorothy? [02:05:03:18-02:05:06:21] Marcee. No, he's right here. [02:05:07:02-02:05:10:20] It's Marcee. She couldn't get through on your phone. [02:05:13:03-02:05:17:19] We did it. I love you. I love you so much! [02:05:22:03-02:05:24:03] I love you! [02:05:29:04-02:05:32:16] I love you, Tyson. I love you, baby. [02:05:32:20-02:05:35:13] How's the baby? How's Katie? [02:05:36:02-02:05:39:00] Oh, I love you so much. [02:05:40:15-02:05:43:19] You know ain't nothing gonna happen to me. [02:05:52:03-02:05:57:03] The problem is, like you were saying earlier, the biorhythms. [02:05:58:16-02:06:01:18] I was saying the neural pathways are set. [02:06:01:22-02:06:06:19] That's why it's hard for people to change. [02:06:10:08-02:06:15:02] I'm sorry, these stupid holidays make me feel more divorced. [02:06:15:15-02:06:20:05] You know? With the songs, the constant chocolate-eating.... [02:06:36:05-02:06:39:05] I have a confession to make. [02:06:39:19-02:06:44:22] I've listened to you all tell a thousand sob stories. [02:06:45:00-02:06:47:04] I've been very judgmental. [02:06:47:08-02:06:51:18] Maybe you're all correct. Men are the enemy. [02:06:51:22-02:06:55:15] No, they're not the enemy. [02:06:55:19-02:06:59:02] But I still love the enemy. [02:07:13:00-02:07:14:05] Hello. [02:07:16:19-02:07:19:02] I'm looking for my wife. [02:07:31:17-02:07:32:20] Wait. [02:07:43:03-02:07:47:17] If this is where it has to happen, then it's where it happens. [02:07:48:20-02:07:53:18] I'm not letting you get rid of me. How about that? [02:07:59:06-02:08:03:09] This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room. [02:08:03:18-02:08:05:06] I'd do it alone. [02:08:06:02-02:08:08:02] And now, I just.... [02:08:14:04-02:08:15:16] I don't know. [02:08:21:02-02:08:22:22] But tonight... [02:08:23:21-02:08:29:04] ...our little project, our company had a very big night. [02:08:29:18-02:08:33:23] A very, very big night. [02:08:36:23-02:08:38:23] But it wasn't complete. [02:08:41:09-02:08:47:02] It wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete... [02:08:47:11-02:08:50:05] ...because I couldn't share it with you. [02:08:51:11-02:08:53:12] I couldn't hear your voice... [02:08:55:23-02:08:58:11] ...or laugh about it with you. [02:09:00:23-02:09:04:02] I missed my-- I missed my wife. [02:09:20:09-02:09:25:18] We live in a cynical world. A cynical world. [02:09:26:04-02:09:31:00] And we work in a business of tough competitors. [02:09:40:11-02:09:42:07] I love you. [02:09:42:12-02:09:44:01] You... [02:09:45:20-02:09:47:12] ...complete me. [02:09:49:00-02:09:51:02] -And I just-- -Shut up. [02:09:52:09-02:09:54:01] Just shut up. [02:09:54:20-02:09:57:00] You had me at hello. [02:09:58:04-02:10:00:10] You had me at hello. [02:10:13:03-02:10:15:21] This is my best discussion group. [02:10:16:01-02:10:20:19] Your father leaves home on Christmas Eve, abandoning your family. [02:10:20:23-02:10:25:08] Your mother had to sweep up at the prison to pay your tuition. [02:10:25:21-02:10:29:05] Your brother lost a leg in a fishing accident. [02:10:29:09-02:10:33:10] You've had a list of horrific things happen in your life. [02:10:33:14-02:10:37:08] -I'm not gonna cry, Roy. -I've got some good news. [02:10:37:12-02:10:40:10] I've just been handed a signed memo. [02:10:40:14-02:10:44:22] It's a contract. Arizona Cardinals. Four years. [02:10:45:02-02:10:50:05] $11.2 million and you'll play in your home state, where it started. [02:10:50:09-02:10:52:08] What do you think of that? [02:11:12:10-02:11:17:03] I love everybody. I love my wife! Marcee! [02:11:18:08-02:11:22:10] I love my kids! Tyson and my new baby, Katie. [02:11:22:14-02:11:27:21] My older brother, who got one leg, and my younger brother, Tee Pee. [02:11:28:01-02:11:31:16] You're militant, but I ain't mad at you. I love you. [02:11:32:00-02:11:35:03] I love my teammates. I'm omitting someone. [02:11:35:09-02:11:40:13] -We only have a half-hour show. -I send love to my offensive line. [02:11:41:13-02:11:45:22] Nice to see you. Congratulations. Good for you. [02:11:46:10-02:11:49:14] You remember Troy from the Super Bowl? [02:11:49:22-02:11:50:23] We met in '93. [02:11:51:02-02:11:54:09] -That's right. I enjoyed your memo. -Thank you. [02:11:54:15-02:11:59:15] -A little slow but you come around. -We're out of time. [02:12:00:00-02:12:02:00] I'm forgetting somebody. [02:12:03:12-02:12:05:13] Jerry Maguire... [02:12:06:08-02:12:08:04] ...my agent. [02:12:11:07-02:12:14:09] You are my ambassador of kwan, man. [02:12:16:00-02:12:20:02] Thank you. Congratulations. We'll be right back. [02:12:23:22-02:12:28:08] -How did you like the zoo, buddy? -It was great! [02:12:28:12-02:12:30:14] One, two, three. [02:12:34:04-02:12:36:08] Hey, kid, throw the ball. [02:12:46:11-02:12:47:17] Good throw, man. [02:12:50:23-02:12:52:12] Did you see? [02:12:53:06-02:12:55:23] Oh, no. Let's go. [02:12:56:07-02:13:01:07] What? I'm not saying we'll throw him into the major leagues tomorrow... [02:13:01:11-02:13:04:07] ...but he's got natural talent. [02:13:04:11-02:13:09:02] I know the right people that'll help develop his talent. [02:13:22:02-02:13:25:03] Hey, I don't have all the answers. [02:13:25:08-02:13:30:16] In life, to be honest, I've failed as much as I've succeeded. [02:13:31:03-02:13:34:14] But I love my wife, I love my life... [02:13:34:18-02:13:37:15] ...and I wish you my kind of success.</property>
