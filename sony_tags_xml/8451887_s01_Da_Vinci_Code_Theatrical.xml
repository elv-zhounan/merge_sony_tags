[00:04:43:12-00:04:47:08] Understanding our past determines actively [00:04:47:09-00:04:50:14] our ability to understand the present. [00:04:50:16-00:04:54:20] So how do we sift truth from belief? [00:04:55:13-00:04:58:22] How do we write our own histories, personally or culturally, [00:04:58:23-00:05:01:03] and thereby define ourselves?

[00:06:07:19-00:06:09:22] We found your name in his daily planner. [00:06:11:03-00:06:13:21] He never showed. I waited for over an hour. [00:06:17:03-00:06:19:19] Why would someone do this to him? [00:06:20:00-00:06:22:13] Oh, you misunderstand, Professor. [00:06:23:11-00:06:25:18] He was shot, yes. [00:06:25:20-00:06:28:14] But what you see in the photograph, [00:06:28:16-00:06:31:02] Monsieur Saunière did to himself. [00:06:34:08-00:06:38:15] Teacher, all four are dead. [00:06:39:12-00:06:42:14] The sénéchaux and the Grand Master himself. [00:06:42:18-00:06:45:20] Then I assume you have the location. [00:06:46:00-00:06:49:03] Confirmed by all. [00:06:49:07-00:06:51:17] Independently. [00:06:52:11-00:06:56:20] I had feared the Priory's penchant for secrecy might prevail. [00:07:00:08-00:07:04:11] The prospect of death is strong motivation. [00:07:07:19-00:07:08:19] He guessed. [00:07:08:23-00:07:10:04] It is here. [00:07:10:14-00:07:13:00] In Paris, Teacher. [00:07:13:22-00:07:19:10] It hides beneath the Rose in SaintSulpice. [00:07:19:22-00:07:22:06] You will go forth, Silas. [00:08:35:15-00:08:39:02] I chastise my body. [00:09:16:21-00:09:18:23] Captain Fache is waiting for you. [00:09:27:07-00:09:28:14] Okay. [00:09:39:22-00:09:41:08] Mr. Langdon. Yes. [00:09:41:21-00:09:43:19] I'm Captain Bezu Fache. [00:09:44:20-00:09:46:08] You like our pyramid? [00:09:46:10-00:09:47:12] It's magnificent. [00:09:48:08-00:09:50:05] A scar on the face of Paris. [00:09:51:09-00:09:53:05] After me, please. [00:09:59:13-00:10:00:20] Ah. [00:10:00:22-00:10:03:00] It's the pairing of those two pyramids. [00:10:03:12-00:10:04:22] It's unique. [00:10:04:23-00:10:07:05] The two are geometric echoes. [00:10:07:08-00:10:08:08] Fascinating. [00:10:11:02-00:10:14:15] I'm not sure how much help I'm gonna be here this evening. [00:10:15:08-00:10:18:00] How well did you know the curator? [00:10:18:01-00:10:19:08] Not very well. [00:10:19:10-00:10:23:00] Frankly, I was surprised when he contacted me. [00:10:31:02-00:10:33:10] Could we take the stairs? [00:10:48:00-00:10:51:10] So Saunière requested tonight's meeting. [00:10:51:12-00:10:52:15] Yes. [00:10:52:20-00:10:54:07] How? Did he call you? [00:10:55:23-00:10:59:05] Email. He heard I was in Paris. [00:11:00:12-00:11:03:11] Had something to discuss. What? [00:11:08:10-00:11:11:05] You seem uncomfortable. [00:11:22:04-00:11:27:02] Ah, the Grande Galerie. This is where you found the body. [00:11:27:04-00:11:28:22] How would you know that? [00:11:29:23-00:11:33:01] I recognize the parquet floor from the Polaroid. [00:11:33:02-00:11:34:16] It's unmistakable. [00:11:44:00-00:11:45:07] Dear God. [00:11:49:07-00:11:51:16] Let's cover the talking points again, Your Eminence. [00:11:51:18-00:11:54:20] Many call Opus Dei a brainwashing cult. [00:11:54:23-00:11:57:16] Others, an ultraconservative Christian secret society. [00:11:57:18-00:12:00:05] Obviously, some people fear what they don't understand. [00:12:00:07-00:12:02:17] Perhaps a less defensive tack, Your Eminence. [00:12:02:19-00:12:04:22] The press continue to be harsh with us. [00:12:06:18-00:12:10:17] We are not, um, Cafeteria Catholics. [00:12:11:04-00:12:13:08] We don't pick and choose which rules to follow. [00:12:13:10-00:12:16:01] We follow doctrine. Rigorously. [00:12:16:20-00:12:20:22] Does doctrine necessarily include vows of chastity, tithing, [00:12:20:23-00:12:24:03] and atonement for sins through selfflagellation and the cilice? [00:12:24:11-00:12:28:15] Many of our followers are married. Many of them have families. [00:12:28:20-00:12:30:08] Only a small proportion [00:12:30:10-00:12:31:20] choose to live ascetic lives. [00:12:31:21-00:12:34:20] Why are some media... That will be all, Michael, thank you. [00:12:35:09-00:12:36:14] Aringarosa. [00:12:37:20-00:12:41:13] Silas has succeeded. The legend is true. [00:12:41:20-00:12:43:18] It hides beneath the Rose. [00:12:44:01-00:12:47:02] My part of our bargain is nearly fulfilled. [00:12:47:14-00:12:50:16] I meet the council in an hour. [00:12:50:22-00:12:54:17] I will have your money tonight, Teacher. [00:12:55:01-00:12:57:12] The Vitruvian Man. [00:12:57:14-00:13:00:05] It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's most famous sketches. [00:13:00:22-00:13:02:20] And the star on his skin? [00:13:03:17-00:13:06:01] A pentacle. And its meaning? [00:13:06:11-00:13:08:13] The pentacle is a pagan religious icon. [00:13:09:03-00:13:10:20] Devil worship. [00:13:10:21-00:13:15:05] No. No, no, no. The pentacle before that. [00:13:16:01-00:13:18:10] This is a symbol for Venus. [00:13:19:04-00:13:21:13] It represents the female half of all things. [00:13:21:14-00:13:24:14] You are telling me that Saunière's last act on earth [00:13:24:15-00:13:28:17] was to draw a goddess symbol on his chest? Why? [00:13:30:04-00:13:33:11] Captain Fache, obviously I can't tell you why. [00:13:34:08-00:13:38:15] I can tell you he, as well as anyone, knows the meaning of this symbol, [00:13:38:16-00:13:41:00] and it has nothing to do with worshiping the devil. [00:13:41:02-00:13:42:14] Is that so? Yes. [00:13:42:16-00:13:46:21] Then what do you make of this? [00:13:47:11-00:13:51:10] O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint. [00:13:51:22-00:13:54:18] It's a phrase. Doesn't mean anything, not to me. [00:13:55:10-00:13:59:00] What would you do if you had such limited time to send a message? [00:14:00:11-00:14:05:01] Well, I suppose I'd try to identify my killer. [00:14:05:22-00:14:07:01] Precisely. [00:14:07:18-00:14:09:07] Precisely. [00:14:09:10-00:14:10:12] So, Professor... [00:14:12:04-00:14:14:06] Officer Neveu. [00:14:14:08-00:14:15:23] Please, pardon the interruption. [00:14:16:01-00:14:17:01] This is not the time. [00:14:17:05-00:14:19:11] I received the crimescene jpegs at headquarters... [00:14:19:15-00:14:21:11] ...and I've deciphered the code. [00:14:21:18-00:14:23:09] It's a Fibonacci sequence. [00:14:23:13-00:14:25:00] That's the code Saunière left on the floor. [00:14:25:02-00:14:26:02] Fibonacci? [00:14:26:06-00:14:28:09] Headquarters sent me to explain, captain. [00:14:28:12-00:14:29:23] It is the Fibonacci sequence. [00:14:30:01-00:14:31:10] The numbers are out of order. [00:14:31:11-00:14:34:11] But before that, I have an urgent message for Professor Langdon. [00:14:34:13-00:14:35:13] Right? [00:14:36:04-00:14:37:10] Hmm? Pardon me? [00:14:39:19-00:14:42:22] I'm Sophie Neveu, French police, Cryptology. [00:14:43:01-00:14:45:01] Your embassy called Division. [00:14:48:11-00:14:49:11] Um... [00:14:49:21-00:14:54:03] I'm sorry, monsieur, they said it was a matter of life and death. [00:14:55:01-00:14:58:01] This is the number of your embassy's messaging service. [00:14:59:02-00:15:00:10] Well, thank you. [00:15:07:19-00:15:10:00] Hello, you've reached the home of Sophie Neveu. [00:15:10:20-00:15:14:02] Miss Neveu? This... [00:15:14:04-00:15:15:10] No. That's the right number. [00:15:15:12-00:15:17:23] You have to dial an access code to pick up your messages. [00:15:18:00-00:15:19:02] But I'm getting... [00:15:19:04-00:15:22:01] It's a threedigit code. It's on the paper I gave you. [00:15:31:06-00:15:34:11] (ON MESSAGE) Professor Langdon, do not react to this message. [00:15:34:13-00:15:37:02] You must follow my directions very closely [00:15:37:04-00:15:40:10] and, above all, reveal nothing to Captain Fache. [00:15:40:11-00:15:42:13] You are in grave danger. [00:15:55:23-00:15:57:12] Church of SaintSulpice. [00:15:57:17-00:15:59:09] Good evening, Sister. [00:16:00:09-00:16:04:04] I need you to show someone our church tonight. [00:16:04:14-00:16:06:00] Of course, Father. [00:16:06:13-00:16:08:06] But so late? [00:16:09:11-00:16:10:11] Wouldn't tomorrow...? [00:16:10:15-00:16:15:10] This is a request from an important bishop of Opus Dei. [00:16:16:03-00:16:18:14] It would be my pleasure. [00:16:42:10-00:16:45:15] There's been an accident. A friend. [00:16:45:16-00:16:49:03] I have to fly home in the morning. I see. [00:16:49:08-00:16:51:04] Is there a restroom I could use? [00:16:51:06-00:16:53:12] I just wanna splash some water on my face. [00:16:53:14-00:16:54:18] Yes. [00:16:56:21-00:16:59:16] She said it is meaningless. [00:17:00:12-00:17:02:07] A mathematical joke. [00:17:03:07-00:17:05:03] Is it meaningless? [00:17:07:19-00:17:09:21] I'll take another look when I come back. [00:17:13:18-00:17:16:04] I'm sorry. Of course. [00:17:30:03-00:17:32:08] Do you have a message from Saunière? [00:17:33:01-00:17:34:16] What are you talking about? [00:17:35:00-00:17:37:02] (SIGHS) Crazy old man. [00:17:37:11-00:17:40:01] You have me confused with someone else. [00:17:40:06-00:17:42:06] I came here to... Check your jacket pocket. [00:17:43:13-00:17:44:21] Just look. [00:17:48:22-00:17:50:16] GPS tracking dot. [00:17:50:19-00:17:54:00] Accurate within two feet anywhere on the globe. [00:17:54:02-00:17:57:03] The agent who picked you up slipped it into your jacket [00:17:59:02-00:18:01:04] in case you tried to run. [00:18:02:17-00:18:05:08] We have you on a little leash, Professor. [00:18:05:16-00:18:07:16] Why would I try to run? I didn't do anything. [00:18:07:19-00:18:11:23] So, what do you think about the fourth line of text [00:18:12:01-00:18:14:21] Fache wiped clean before you arrived? [00:18:20:23-00:18:24:14] He brought you here to force a confession, Professor Langdon. [00:18:28:07-00:18:31:01] He's still in there? What's he doing? [00:18:31:03-00:18:34:15] Fache isn't even looking for other suspects, okay? [00:18:34:16-00:18:36:04] He is sure you're guilty. [00:18:39:20-00:18:42:10] When did Saunière contact you? [00:18:42:15-00:18:43:23] Today? Yes, yes. [00:18:44:01-00:18:46:01] What time? What time? [00:18:46:03-00:18:48:09] Uh, at 300. Around 3: 00. 3:00. [00:18:48:10-00:18:52:06] We call Fache the Bull. Once he starts, he doesn't stop. [00:18:52:08-00:18:55:15] He can arrest you and detain you for months while he builds a case. [00:18:55:17-00:18:59:04] And by then whatever Saunière wanted you to tell me will be useless. [00:18:59:06-00:19:01:14] Lady, stop it! Just stop! [00:19:01:23-00:19:08:22] Who are you? [00:19:08:10-00:19:10:06] Look at the letters. [00:19:13:08-00:19:15:01] P.S., postscript. [00:19:16:10-00:19:19:06] Princess Sophie. Silly, I know. [00:19:19:08-00:19:22:02] But I was only a girl when I lived with him. [00:19:25:12-00:19:28:01] Jacques Saunière was my grandfather. [00:19:33:05-00:19:36:13] Apparently, it was his dying wish that we meet. [00:19:38:08-00:19:40:16] If you help me understand why [00:19:40:18-00:19:44:10] I will get you to your embassy, where we cannot arrest you. [00:19:45:16-00:19:48:10] Fache was never gonna let me just stroll out of here, was he? [00:19:49:04-00:19:50:11] No. [00:19:51:09-00:19:55:04] If we are to get away from here, we must find another way. [00:20:03:23-00:20:06:06] What exactly do you propose? [00:20:15:20-00:20:18:16] Saunière was reading his book. [00:20:19:01-00:20:21:00] Blood trail. [00:20:23:01-00:20:24:21] Excuse me, captain. [00:20:25:03-00:20:27:02] We have a problem. [00:20:27:08-00:20:30:07] Headquarters didn't send Sophie Neveu. [00:20:32:13-00:20:33:18] What? [00:20:33:22-00:20:37:07] Captain, look at this. [00:20:38:22-00:20:40:04] He jumped! [00:20:40:18-00:20:41:20] Shit. [00:20:44:00-00:20:47:04] He's moving again. And fast. [00:20:47:21-00:20:49:16] He must be in a car. [00:20:51:02-00:20:55:07] He's going south on Pont du Carrousel. [00:21:04:00-00:21:05:07] Bastard. [00:21:28:20-00:21:31:14] That cop will check the whole lower floor. [00:21:35:13-00:21:37:20] I will only take a moment. [00:21:38:08-00:21:39:14] Of course. [00:21:48:07-00:21:50:11] He is much older than I remember. [00:22:02:05-00:22:05:15] I hadn't seen or spoken to him in a very long time. [00:22:14:18-00:22:18:17] He phoned my office today. Several times. [00:22:19:22-00:22:22:22] He said it was a matter of life and death. [00:22:23:11-00:22:26:19] I thought it was another trick to get back in touch. [00:22:29:10-00:22:32:05] It seems when he couldn't speak to me, [00:22:33:12-00:22:35:12] he reached out to you. [00:22:52:13-00:22:54:22] Wait a minute. Professor? [00:22:56:15-00:22:59:21] This is wrong. Yeah. See? This is wrong. [00:23:01:13-00:23:05:04] The Fibonacci numbers only make sense when they're in order. [00:23:05:05-00:23:06:19] These are scrambled. [00:23:06:20-00:23:10:14] If he was trying to reach out, maybe he was doing it in code. [00:23:10:17-00:23:12:13] Would you hold this, please? [00:23:15:02-00:23:17:00] This phrase is meaningless. [00:23:19:01-00:23:23:15] Unless you assume these letters are out of order too. [00:23:23:17-00:23:24:21] An anagram. [00:23:36:15-00:23:38:10] You have eidetic memory? [00:23:38:17-00:23:42:06] Not quite. But I can pretty much remember what I see. [00:23:59:06-00:24:00:06] Whoa. [00:24:03:15-00:24:05:14] Anagram is right. [00:24:06:23-00:24:09:13] O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint becomes [00:24:09:15-00:24:12:06] Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa. [00:24:12:14-00:24:16:06] Professor, the Mona Lisa is right over here. [00:24:22:18-00:24:27:18] Look at this. He must have thrown it from the window. [00:24:28:02-00:24:29:16] Smart to hit the truck. [00:24:30:02-00:24:33:15] What, you admire him now? [00:24:35:05-00:24:37:07] We're stupid. Who did we leave at the museum? [00:24:37:11-00:24:40:06] Ledoux? Get him on the radio! [00:24:40:11-00:24:43:13] Her smile is in the lower spatial frequencies. [00:24:43:15-00:24:47:10] The horizon is significantly lower on the left than it is on the right. [00:24:47:12-00:24:48:15] Why? [00:24:48:16-00:24:52:05] Well, see, she appears larger from the left than on the right. [00:24:52:07-00:24:55:11] Historically, the left was female, the right was male. [00:24:55:13-00:24:57:06] There. Blood. [00:25:05:17-00:25:06:20] Hey. [00:25:08:12-00:25:11:03] So dark the con of man. [00:25:11:23-00:25:15:06] No. It doesn't say that. [00:25:15:11-00:25:17:19] Is it another anagram? Can you break it? [00:25:22:16-00:25:25:04] Professor, hurry. Hurry! Uh... [00:25:26:20-00:25:29:19] Moon. Sermon. Charms. [00:25:30:00-00:25:33:23] Demons. Omens. Codes. Monks. Ranks. Rocks. [00:25:34:01-00:25:35:07] Madonna of the Rocks. [00:25:36:01-00:25:37:02] Da Vinci. [00:25:47:12-00:25:49:06] Careful. Careful. [00:25:56:17-00:26:00:13] This can't be this. The fleurdelis. [00:26:40:10-00:26:42:02] It was Saunière's. [00:26:42:17-00:26:45:15] I remember finding it once when I was a girl. [00:26:46:12-00:26:48:18] He'd promised he'd give it to me one day. [00:26:49:13-00:26:51:21] Have you ever heard those words before, Sophie? [00:26:51:23-00:26:53:11] So dark the con of man? [00:26:53:13-00:26:55:04] No. Have you? [00:26:55:06-00:26:58:21] When you were a child, were you aware of any secret gatherings? [00:27:00:00-00:27:02:09] Anything ritualistic in nature? [00:27:02:13-00:27:05:19] Meetings your grandfather would've wanted kept secret? [00:27:06:00-00:27:09:12] Was there ever any talk of something called the Priory of Sion? [00:27:09:15-00:27:12:14] The what? Why are you asking these things? [00:27:12:18-00:27:15:19] The Priory of Sion is a myth. [00:27:15:21-00:27:18:03] One of the world's oldest and most secret societies, [00:27:18:05-00:27:22:17] with leaders like Sir Isaac Newton, da Vinci himself. [00:27:23:01-00:27:24:22] The fleurdelis is their crest. [00:27:24:23-00:27:27:17] They're guardians of a secret they supposedly refer to [00:27:27:19-00:27:30:00] as the dark con of man. [00:27:30:14-00:27:32:00] But what secret? [00:27:32:12-00:27:37:20] The Priory of Sion protects the source of God's power on Earth. [00:27:46:18-00:27:48:15] I can't do this by myself. [00:27:49:04-00:27:52:06] I'm in enough trouble as it is. That's my embassy. [00:27:52:07-00:27:53:09] Please. [00:27:53:11-00:27:55:22] Even if we could get out of this... Okay. [00:28:33:01-00:28:36:10] No, no, no. You're not gonna make it. You're not gonna make it! [00:28:44:01-00:28:45:09] Well, that was... [00:28:54:06-00:28:56:01] We need to get out of sight. [00:29:10:16-00:29:12:23] Christ, give me strength. [00:29:24:06-00:29:25:06] Aah! [00:29:25:12-00:29:28:04] You are a ghost. [00:29:30:21-00:29:33:03] Christ, give me strength. [00:30:10:11-00:30:13:02] Stealing in a house of God! [00:30:26:10-00:30:28:10] You are an angel. [00:30:30:16-00:30:32:22] Christ, give me strength. [00:30:58:09-00:31:00:13] You have powerful friends. [00:31:01:07-00:31:04:10] Bishop Aringarosa has been kind to me. [00:31:05:01-00:31:09:01] I could not miss this chance to pray inside the SaintSulpice. [00:31:09:22-00:31:12:09] A pity you couldn't wait for morning. [00:31:12:11-00:31:14:11] The light is not ideal. [00:31:15:10-00:31:19:13] Tell me, Sister, please, of the Rose Line. [00:31:19:23-00:31:25:04] A rose line is any line that goes from the North to South Poles. [00:31:25:06-00:31:30:04] Set into the streets of Paris, 135 brass markers [00:31:30:05-00:31:33:03] mark the world's first prime meridian [00:31:33:05-00:31:35:15] which passed through this very church. [00:31:35:17-00:31:37:13] It hides beneath the Rose. [00:31:37:17-00:31:38:22] I'm sorry? [00:31:40:08-00:31:41:14] Sister. [00:31:44:06-00:31:47:14] I do not want to keep you. I will show myself out. [00:31:50:19-00:31:51:22] I insist. [00:31:56:04-00:31:59:02] May the peace of the Lord be with you. [00:32:00:17-00:32:02:03] And with you. [00:32:15:17-00:32:20:20] They found Neveu's car abandoned at the train station. [00:32:21:15-00:32:26:12] And two tickets to Brussels paid for with Langdon's credit card. [00:32:26:18-00:32:28:05] A decoy, I'm sure. [00:32:28:10-00:32:30:20] All the same, send an officer to the station. [00:32:31:02-00:32:33:17] Question all the taxi drivers. I'll put this on the wire. [00:32:33:23-00:32:36:18] Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty. [00:32:37:02-00:32:40:21] I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt. [00:32:41:01-00:32:44:00] Robert Langdon is guilty. [00:32:52:23-00:32:54:05] This is the Bois de Boulogne? [00:32:54:07-00:32:57:03] We should be safe in this park for a few minutes. [00:33:42:00-00:33:42:23] No! [00:33:49:02-00:33:50:09] Stay here. [00:33:52:03-00:33:53:11] Police. [00:33:54:23-00:33:56:07] What do you want? [00:34:01:20-00:34:03:22] Fifty euros for all your stuff. [00:34:06:03-00:34:08:07] Go and get something to eat. [00:34:28:06-00:34:30:04] Did it ever occur to you that could be dangerous? [00:34:30:06-00:34:33:11] No. And now we have a place to think. [00:34:34:05-00:34:35:22] Any ideas, Professor? [00:34:37:03-00:34:40:16] You could've just handed me a piece of a UFO from Area 51. [00:34:42:19-00:34:44:20] What's the next step? [00:34:45:09-00:34:47:00] With him, it's always, [00:34:47:02-00:34:50:05] Sophie, what's the next step? [00:34:50:20-00:34:52:10] Puzzles. [00:34:52:12-00:34:53:21] Codes. [00:34:54:18-00:34:55:22] A treasure hunt. [00:35:00:12-00:35:01:18] To find his killer. [00:35:06:01-00:35:09:11] Maybe there is something about this Priory of Sion. [00:35:09:15-00:35:10:15] I hope not. [00:35:10:22-00:35:15:16] Any Priory story ends in bloodshed. They were butchered by the Church. [00:35:16:02-00:35:19:06] It all started over a thousand years ago when a French king [00:35:19:08-00:35:21:18] conquered the holy city of Jerusalem. [00:35:22:02-00:35:25:13] This crusade, one of the most massive and sweeping in history, [00:35:25:14-00:35:29:05] was actually orchestrated by a secret brotherhood, [00:35:29:07-00:35:30:12] the Priory of Sion [00:35:30:13-00:35:34:20] and their military arm, the Knights Templar. [00:35:35:09-00:35:38:10] But the Templars were created to protect the Holy Land. [00:35:38:15-00:35:42:15] That was a cover to hide their true goal, according to this myth. [00:35:43:03-00:35:46:05] Supposedly the invasion was to find an artifact [00:35:46:07-00:35:48:05] lost since the time of Christ. [00:35:48:07-00:35:52:10] An artifact, it was said, the Church would kill to possess. [00:35:52:21-00:35:55:12] Did they find it, this buried treasure? [00:35:56:17-00:35:57:23] Put it this way. [00:35:58:01-00:36:00:12] One day the Templars simply stopped searching. [00:36:01:06-00:36:04:09] They quit the Holy Land and traveled directly to Rome. [00:36:04:22-00:36:06:22] Whether they blackmailed the papacy [00:36:07:00-00:36:09:09] or the Church bought their silence, no one knows. [00:36:09:10-00:36:13:15] But it is a fact the papacy declared these Priory knights, [00:36:13:16-00:36:17:07] these Knights Templar, of limitless power. [00:36:18:12-00:36:21:19] By the 1300s, the Templars had grown too powerful. [00:36:21:20-00:36:23:06] Too threatening. [00:36:23:12-00:36:25:16] So the Vatican issued secret orders [00:36:26:02-00:36:28:21] to be opened simultaneously all across Europe. [00:36:29:18-00:36:33:13] The Pope had declared the Knights Templar Satan worshipers [00:36:33:15-00:36:37:20] and said God had charged him with cleansing the Earth of these heretics. [00:36:38:08-00:36:40:16] The plan went off like clockwork. [00:36:41:09-00:36:44:00] The Templars were all but exterminated. [00:36:44:02-00:36:48:07] The date was October 13, 1307. A Friday. [00:36:48:13-00:36:50:06] Friday the 13th. [00:36:51:03-00:36:54:04] The Pope sent troops to claim the Priory's treasure, [00:36:54:05-00:36:55:20] but they found nothing. [00:36:55:23-00:36:59:11] The few surviving Knights of the Priory had vanished, [00:36:59:12-00:37:02:13] and the search for their sacred artifact began again. [00:37:02:15-00:37:06:01] What artifact? I've never heard about any of this. [00:37:07:00-00:37:08:12] Yes, you have. [00:37:08:21-00:37:10:14] Almost everyone on Earth has. [00:37:11:14-00:37:14:06] You just know it as the Holy Grail. [00:37:20:09-00:37:23:19] Please, Saunière thought he knew the location of the Holy Grail? [00:37:24:22-00:37:26:19] Maybe more than that. [00:37:27:00-00:37:30:21] This cross and the flower, this could be very old. But look. [00:37:30:23-00:37:35:12] This metal here underneath is much newer, and there's a modern ID stamp. [00:37:36:08-00:37:37:18] Haxo 24. [00:37:40:09-00:37:43:18] And these dots. These dots are read by a laser. [00:37:43:23-00:37:47:16] This is more than a pendant. This is a key your grandfather left you. [00:37:47:21-00:37:50:01] He left us, Professor. [00:37:51:19-00:37:56:03] And vingtquatre Haxo, it's not an ID stamp. [00:37:56:15-00:37:58:12] It's a street address. [00:38:03:11-00:38:05:01] This is Jacques Saunière. [00:38:05:10-00:38:07:20] Please leave a message after the tone. [00:38:08:23-00:38:11:08] Please, Monsieur Saunière, pick up the phone. [00:38:11:14-00:38:13:02] This is Sandrine Bieil. [00:38:13:08-00:38:15:14] I have called the list. [00:38:16:00-00:38:17:22] I fear the other guardians are dead. [00:38:18:12-00:38:20:10] The lie has been told. [00:38:20:18-00:38:22:16] The floor panel has been broken. [00:38:23:08-00:38:26:18] Please, monsieur, pick up the phone. I beg you. [00:38:26:20-00:38:28:14] Job 38, verse 11. [00:38:30:08-00:38:32:07] Do you know it, Sister? [00:38:34:02-00:38:35:20] Job 38: 11. [00:38:37:12-00:38:41:18] Hitherto shalt thou come but no further. [00:38:42:12-00:38:43:21] But no further. [00:38:48:01-00:38:49:21] Do you mock me? [00:38:52:19-00:38:54:22] Where is the keystone? [00:38:55:22-00:38:57:16] I do not know. [00:38:58:17-00:38:59:20] No. [00:39:02:03-00:39:04:12] You are a sister of the Church [00:39:06:20-00:39:10:09] and yet you serve them, the Priory. [00:39:10:11-00:39:14:08] Jesus had but one true message, that... [00:39:27:09-00:39:30:02] Come, you saints of God. [00:39:31:00-00:39:33:15] Hasten, angels of the Lord. [00:39:34:09-00:39:37:03] To receive her soul. [00:39:37:14-00:39:42:04] And bring her to the sight of the Almighty. [00:40:00:15-00:40:02:07] Welcome, Bishop. [00:40:03:05-00:40:05:06] This council is convened. [00:40:13:19-00:40:17:06] Our words shall never pass these walls. [00:40:20:08-00:40:22:00] What business, say you? [00:40:23:23-00:40:26:03] As you know, my request for funds... [00:40:26:05-00:40:30:00] Yes, 20 million euro in untraceable bearer bonds. [00:40:30:16-00:40:33:23] A tad more than petty cash. Wouldn't you say, Bishop? [00:40:35:18-00:40:40:10] I only offer a route to the renewal of faith for all men. [00:40:40:12-00:40:41:23] How humble. [00:40:42:00-00:40:44:20] Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa. [00:40:44:22-00:40:46:11] How dare you presume to... [00:40:46:12-00:40:48:06] I do not presume, I act! [00:40:48:18-00:40:52:15] The Vatican's unwillingness to support us is both impious and cowardly. [00:40:52:22-00:40:57:01] Blood is being spilled because true Christian values lie in ruins. No more! [00:40:57:17-00:41:00:22] This council has forgotten its very purpose. [00:41:03:15-00:41:08:11] Tonight, the Grail will be destroyed. [00:41:08:13-00:41:12:02] The Priory's few remaining members will be silenced. [00:41:20:07-00:41:24:13] I was contacted by a man who calls himself only the Teacher. [00:41:27:03-00:41:29:16] Two prostitutes identified Langdon and Neveu... [00:41:29:20-00:41:32:02] ...getting into a taxi in the Bois de Boulogne. [00:41:42:00-00:41:43:22] Because of your expertise? [00:41:45:02-00:41:46:17] I'm sorry? About the Priory. [00:41:46:18-00:41:49:05] Do you think that's why Saunière sought you out? [00:41:49:19-00:41:53:01] I can think of dozens of scholars who know a lot more about it. [00:41:53:03-00:41:57:04] Actually, I didn't think he liked me very much. [00:41:57:20-00:42:01:10] Once made a joke at my expense. Got a big laugh out of it. [00:42:01:12-00:42:02:20] What was it? [00:42:16:00-00:42:17:19] How may I help you? [00:42:23:16-00:42:25:23] The door to the right, please. [00:42:44:10-00:42:47:02] Good evening. I am André Vernet, the night manager. [00:42:48:14-00:42:51:21] I take it this is your first visit to our establishment? [00:42:52:16-00:42:53:18] Yes. [00:42:54:12-00:42:55:19] Understood. [00:42:56:15-00:42:58:03] Keys are often passed on [00:42:58:04-00:43:01:21] and firsttime users are sometimes uncertain of protocol. [00:43:03:16-00:43:06:12] Keys are essentially numbered Swiss accounts. [00:43:08:02-00:43:10:15] Often willed through generations. [00:43:13:13-00:43:16:00] Is it yours, mademoiselle? [00:43:18:03-00:43:21:03] The shortest safetydepositbox lease is 50 years. [00:43:22:03-00:43:24:05] And what's your longest account? [00:43:24:10-00:43:25:23] Quite a bit longer. [00:43:26:11-00:43:29:02] Technologies change, keys are updated. [00:43:34:11-00:43:36:06] Once the computer confirms your key, [00:43:36:08-00:43:39:08] enter your account number and your box is retrieved. [00:43:40:02-00:43:42:12] The room is yours, as long as you like. [00:43:47:13-00:43:50:18] What if I lost track of my account number? [00:43:51:08-00:43:52:19] How might I recover it? [00:43:55:02-00:43:57:18] I'm afraid each key is paired with a 10digit number [00:43:57:20-00:44:00:00] known only to the account bearer. [00:44:00:02-00:44:02:03] I hope you manage to remember it. [00:44:02:19-00:44:05:10] A single wrong entry disables the system. [00:44:12:08-00:44:13:14] Ten. Ten. [00:44:13:16-00:44:16:04] Your grandfather's Fibonacci sequence. [00:44:19:07-00:44:21:16] Scrambled, unscrambled? [00:44:22:14-00:44:23:21] Unscrambled. [00:44:24:14-00:44:26:06] It's your key. [00:44:30:23-00:44:34:16] Funny, I don't even like history. [00:44:37:19-00:44:42:08] I've never seen much good come from looking to the past. [00:44:49:19-00:44:51:07] Moment of truth. [00:45:35:22-00:45:38:11] My God. I don't believe this. [00:45:38:22-00:45:40:02] A rose. [00:45:44:22-00:45:46:18] The rose was a symbol for the Holy Grail. [00:45:49:15-00:45:51:15] Forgive the intrusion. [00:45:51:16-00:45:54:19] I'm afraid the police arrived more quickly than anticipated. [00:45:55:22-00:45:57:17] You must follow me, please. [00:45:57:21-00:45:59:06] For your own safety. [00:45:59:15-00:46:01:09] You knew they were coming? [00:46:01:10-00:46:04:07] My guard alerted me to your status when you arrived. [00:46:04:09-00:46:07:09] Yours is one of our oldest and highestlevel accounts. [00:46:07:10-00:46:09:16] It includes a safepassage clause. [00:46:09:21-00:46:11:01] Safe passage? [00:46:11:22-00:46:15:04] If you would step inside, please. Time is of the essence. [00:46:18:07-00:46:19:14] In there? [00:46:34:18-00:46:36:13] Hey, is there a problem? [00:46:36:19-00:46:39:10] Good evening, sir. Police. [00:46:39:21-00:46:43:23] I just drive from here to Zurich. Not French, English? [00:46:44:05-00:46:45:08] English? Yes. [00:46:46:18-00:46:49:09] We are looking for two criminals. [00:46:50:16-00:46:53:13] You came to the right place. They're all criminals here. [00:46:55:08-00:46:57:16] Would you mind opening the hold? [00:46:58:05-00:47:01:21] Please. You think they trust us, the wages I get paid? [00:47:01:23-00:47:03:23] You don't have keys to your own truck? [00:47:04:01-00:47:06:17] It's armored. Keys get sent to the destination. [00:47:06:22-00:47:09:00] You mind? I'm on a schedule here. [00:47:12:13-00:47:16:22] And do all the drivers wear a Rolex? [00:47:17:10-00:47:18:12] What? [00:47:20:22-00:47:22:15] This piece of shit. [00:47:22:16-00:47:24:14] Forty euros in Barbés. [00:47:24:15-00:47:25:19] Yours for 35. [00:47:26:03-00:47:27:12] (LAUGHS) No, no, no. [00:47:27:14-00:47:29:10] Thirty. No. It's okay, it's okay. [00:47:29:13-00:47:32:08] Come on, 30? I said, no! [00:47:32:21-00:47:34:00] Move along! [00:47:47:11-00:47:48:16] Now we wait. [00:47:48:18-00:47:51:11] The Teacher will call and tell me where to deliver the money. [00:47:51:13-00:47:54:22] You have put tremendous faith in this Teacher of yours. [00:47:54:23-00:47:59:09] Yes, I have. And I have given him an angel to do his will. [00:47:59:21-00:48:03:06] For surely there is no better soldier for God than my Silas. [00:48:04:14-00:48:08:01] I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace, to confess my sins... [00:48:08:06-00:48:13:01] ...to do penance and to amend my life. [00:48:13:09-00:48:14:09] Amen. [00:48:29:17-00:48:31:07] The Holy Grail. [00:48:32:03-00:48:37:02] A magic cup. The source of God's power on earth. [00:48:37:04-00:48:38:11] It's nonsense. [00:48:39:10-00:48:41:08] You don't believe in God. [00:48:42:05-00:48:43:08] No. [00:48:44:07-00:48:45:19] Just people. [00:48:47:02-00:48:49:16] Um, sometimes that they can be kind. [00:48:51:01-00:48:53:15] Are you a Godfearing man, Professor? [00:48:55:05-00:48:57:00] I was raised a Catholic. [00:48:57:17-00:49:00:02] Well, that's not really an answer. [00:49:02:03-00:49:03:21] Professor, are you okay? [00:49:04:22-00:49:06:12] Ah, go ahead, open it. [00:49:07:09-00:49:08:10] Go on. [00:49:15:12-00:49:16:20] A cryptex. [00:49:18:04-00:49:20:16] They are used to keep secrets. [00:49:21:11-00:49:23:14] It's da Vinci's design. [00:49:24:08-00:49:27:18] You write the information on a papyrus scroll [00:49:27:20-00:49:32:22] which is then rolled around a thin glass vial of vinegar. [00:49:33:00-00:49:36:07] If you force it open, the vial breaks, [00:49:36:09-00:49:39:01] vinegar dissolves papyrus, [00:49:40:23-00:49:43:13] and your secret is lost forever. [00:49:43:23-00:49:46:03] The only way to access the information [00:49:46:04-00:49:51:20] is to spell out the password with these five dials, each with 26 letters. [00:49:52:21-00:49:56:17] That's 12 million possibilities. [00:49:57:12-00:50:01:00] I've never met a girl who knew that much about a cryptex. [00:50:02:08-00:50:04:14] Saunière made one for me once. [00:50:12:13-00:50:15:18] My grandfather gave me a wagon. [00:50:18:08-00:50:20:14] This clearly is not the Holy Grail. [00:50:24:12-00:50:25:16] Come on. [00:50:25:22-00:50:27:09] Please, you're not all right. [00:50:30:18-00:50:32:06] May I try something? [00:50:32:22-00:50:34:12] I don't know why it works. [00:50:35:10-00:50:38:11] My mother used to do it when I was scared, I think. [00:50:39:08-00:50:40:15] You think? [00:50:41:10-00:50:42:12] Yes. [00:50:54:09-00:50:56:06] Feeling better, Sophie? [00:51:08:05-00:51:12:15] My parents died in a car crash with my brother. [00:51:13:19-00:51:15:03] I was four. [00:51:17:04-00:51:18:13] I'm sorry. [00:51:19:22-00:51:21:20] It was many years ago. [00:51:37:12-00:51:38:18] Better? [00:51:41:13-00:51:42:13] Yeah. [00:51:43:07-00:51:44:10] Okay. [00:52:10:13-00:52:13:04] Twenty years waiting for someone to come for that box, [00:52:13:06-00:52:15:18] and now it's you two murderers. Bring it to me. [00:52:16:17-00:52:18:10] I don't know what you're talking about. [00:52:19:14-00:52:21:09] All right! Okay! [00:52:22:06-00:52:23:06] Right now! [00:52:33:16-00:52:34:16] Step back! [00:52:38:16-00:52:41:02] No one will lose sleep over a couple on a killing spree. [00:52:44:06-00:52:45:07] Turn around. [00:52:46:14-00:52:48:00] Turn around! [00:52:48:14-00:52:50:06] You too, mademoiselle. [00:53:13:01-00:53:14:05] Sophie! [00:53:15:00-00:53:16:09] Get in the truck! [00:53:16:21-00:53:18:10] I'll drive! Hurry! [00:53:47:14-00:53:51:20] What happened between you and your grandfather, exactly? [00:53:53:10-00:53:57:05] I've jammed my shoulder, I've been shot at, I'm bleeding. [00:53:57:08-00:53:58:22] I need to know. [00:53:59:03-00:54:02:22] You say he raised you, but you two don't talk anymore. [00:54:02:23-00:54:04:19] You call him by his last name. [00:54:05:09-00:54:07:14] You say you hate history. [00:54:07:15-00:54:10:03] Nobody hates history. They hate their own histories. [00:54:10:04-00:54:12:04] So now you're a psychologist too? [00:54:12:15-00:54:17:05] What if Saunière had started to groom you for the Priory? [00:54:17:07-00:54:18:19] What do you mean, groom me? [00:54:18:21-00:54:22:02] Your grandfather gave you puzzles and cryptex as a child. [00:54:22:04-00:54:26:05] So you are saying all this is real? The Priory, the Holy Grail? [00:54:26:10-00:54:29:16] We've been dragged into a world of people who think this stuff is real. [00:54:29:18-00:54:31:20] Real enough to kill for. Who? [00:54:38:02-00:54:40:15] I'm out of my field here. [00:54:43:01-00:54:48:08] I do know a Grail historian, absolutely obsessed with Priory myth. [00:54:49:00-00:54:51:08] An Englishman, lives here in France. [00:54:51:09-00:54:53:00] Do you trust this man? [00:54:54:03-00:54:55:16] I hope you can. [00:55:05:06-00:55:08:03] It seems you're not a driver at all. [00:55:09:23-00:55:14:18] Apparently, you lost your tongue along with your truck. [00:55:15:09-00:55:18:02] You think you're in pain now, André Vernet? [00:55:18:12-00:55:22:12] My cause is worth your life. Understand? [00:55:26:20-00:55:28:10] What do you want? [00:55:28:17-00:55:34:00] Your truck carries a homing device. Activate it. [00:55:41:15-00:55:44:08] Please wait. I'll see if he's available. [00:55:44:11-00:55:46:09] It's on the wrong side. [00:55:46:11-00:55:49:02] Leigh likes all things to be English, including his cars. [00:55:49:04-00:55:52:07] Robert! Do I owe you money? [00:55:53:00-00:55:56:00] Leigh, my friend, [00:55:56:02-00:55:59:05] care to open up for an old colleague? [00:55:59:06-00:56:01:00] Of course. Thank you. [00:56:01:20-00:56:04:05] But first, a test of honor. [00:56:04:15-00:56:06:08] Three questions. [00:56:09:15-00:56:10:23] Fire away. [00:56:11:01-00:56:12:11] Your first. [00:56:12:16-00:56:15:08] Shall I serve coffee or tea? [00:56:16:05-00:56:17:17] Tea, of course. [00:56:17:19-00:56:18:23] Excellent. [00:56:19:01-00:56:21:08] Second. Milk or lemon? [00:56:22:09-00:56:23:10] Milk? [00:56:24:19-00:56:27:06] That would depend on the tea. [00:56:27:08-00:56:28:09] Correct. [00:56:29:07-00:56:33:12] And now the third and most grave of inquiries. [00:56:33:14-00:56:39:02] In which year did a Harvard sculler outrow an Oxford man at Henley? [00:56:46:13-00:56:50:07] Surely such a travesty has never occurred. [00:56:50:22-00:56:52:19] Your heart is true. [00:56:53:15-00:56:55:00] You may pass. [00:56:56:20-00:56:59:04] Welcome to Château Villette. [00:57:02:02-00:57:04:17] The truck's signal is coming online. [00:57:04:22-00:57:06:09] It's about time. [00:57:10:02-00:57:11:17] Locked on and tracking, sir. [00:57:14:14-00:57:17:23] Very good. Tell Collet not to move in until I get there. [00:57:18:12-00:57:23:01] Attention! All of Collet's units to Château Villette. [00:57:23:23-00:57:27:07] The suspects Neveu and Langdon are likely at that location. [00:57:43:14-00:57:44:22] Aringarosa. [00:57:55:21-00:57:58:22] I still don't know why he put you into this [00:57:59:15-00:58:01:12] and I'm sorry. [00:58:06:15-00:58:10:11] But I'm also very glad. [00:58:28:17-00:58:31:09] You are requested to make yourself at home. [00:58:39:16-00:58:40:20] Robert! [00:58:41:23-00:58:44:12] And you travel with a maiden, it seems. [00:58:44:20-00:58:48:02] Sir Leigh Teabing, may I present Miss Sophie Neveu. [00:58:48:04-00:58:50:07] Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing. [00:58:50:16-00:58:54:12] It's an honor to welcome you... [00:58:55:02-00:58:57:05] ...even though it's late. [00:58:57:07-00:59:01:03] Thank you for having us. I realize it's quite late. [00:59:02:10-00:59:05:10] So late, mademoiselle, it's almost early. [00:59:08:01-00:59:09:16] What a lovely smile you have. [00:59:12:00-00:59:13:00] Earl Grey? [00:59:13:17-00:59:14:19] Lemon. [00:59:15:12-00:59:16:16] Correct. [00:59:37:13-00:59:39:19] Château Villette. Yes. [00:59:41:12-00:59:43:14] A dramatic latenight arrival. [00:59:43:22-00:59:46:13] What can an old cripple do for you, Robert? [00:59:47:11-00:59:51:09] We wanna talk about the Priory of Sion. [00:59:51:12-00:59:52:17] The keepers? [00:59:53:15-00:59:54:21] The secret war? [00:59:54:23-00:59:56:23] Sorry for all the mystery. [00:59:57:21-01:00:00:23] Leigh, I'm into something here that I cannot understand. [01:00:01:10-01:00:02:12] You? [01:00:03:06-01:00:06:14] Really? Not without your help. [01:00:07:01-01:00:10:06] Playing to my vanity, Robert. You should be ashamed. [01:00:10:07-01:00:11:12] Not if it works. [01:00:14:03-01:00:16:07] There are always four. [01:00:17:02-01:00:20:05] The Grand Master and the three sénéchaux [01:00:20:10-01:00:23:20] make up the primary guardians of the Grail. [01:00:25:18-01:00:27:17] Thank you, Remy. That'll be all for now. [01:00:34:07-01:00:37:18] The Priory's members span our very globe itself. [01:00:37:20-01:00:42:10] Philippe de Chérisey exposed that as a hoax in 1967. [01:00:42:11-01:00:44:15] And that is what they want you to believe. [01:00:45:08-01:00:48:06] The Priory is charged with a single task. [01:00:48:08-01:00:51:20] To protect the greatest secret in modern history. [01:00:51:21-01:00:54:11] The source of God's power on Earth. [01:00:54:12-01:00:56:07] No, that's a common misunderstanding. [01:00:56:09-01:01:01:01] The Priory protects the source of the Church's power on Earth. [01:01:02:01-01:01:03:08] The Holy Grail. [01:01:03:21-01:01:05:15] I don't understand. [01:01:05:17-01:01:09:20] What power? Some magic dishes? [01:01:10:14-01:01:14:16] (CHUCKLES) Robert. Has he been telling you that the Holy Grail is a cup? [01:01:29:05-01:01:31:17] The Good Book did not arrive [01:01:31:19-01:01:33:01] by facsimile from heaven. [01:01:33:19-01:01:38:10] The Bible as we know it was finally presided over by one man. [01:01:38:12-01:01:40:06] The pagan emperor Constantine. [01:01:40:16-01:01:42:19] I thought Constantine was a Christian. [01:01:43:00-01:01:46:02] Oh, hardly, no. He was a lifelong pagan [01:01:46:03-01:01:48:19] who was baptized on his deathbed. [01:01:48:20-01:01:51:15] Constantine was Rome's supreme holy man. [01:01:52:15-01:01:54:07] From time immemorial, [01:01:54:08-01:01:58:23] his people had worshiped a balance between nature's male deities [01:01:59:00-01:02:02:12] and the goddess or sacred feminine. [01:02:03:08-01:02:06:21] But a growing religious turmoil was gripping Rome. [01:02:07:13-01:02:09:13] Three centuries earlier, [01:02:09:14-01:02:12:10] a young Jew named Jesus had come along, [01:02:12:12-01:02:14:23] preaching love and a single God. [01:02:15:06-01:02:18:02] Centuries after his crucifixion, [01:02:18:21-01:02:21:05] Christ's followers had grown exponentially [01:02:21:07-01:02:24:09] and had started a religious war against the pagans. [01:02:29:12-01:02:32:21] Or did the pagans commence war against the Christians? [01:02:33:13-01:02:36:19] Leigh, we can't be sure who began the atrocities in that period. [01:02:36:20-01:02:40:01] But we can at least agree that the conflict grew to such proportions [01:02:40:03-01:02:41:19] that it threatened to tear Rome in two. [01:02:42:19-01:02:46:07] So Constantine may have been a lifelong pagan, [01:02:46:09-01:02:48:02] but he was also a pragmatist. [01:02:48:03-01:02:50:16] And in 325 Anno Domini, [01:02:50:18-01:02:55:23] he decided to unify Rome under a single religion, Christianity. [01:02:56:00-01:02:59:20] Christianity was on the rise. He didn't want his empire torn apart. [01:03:00:10-01:03:03:12] And to strengthen this new Christian tradition, [01:03:03:14-01:03:06:06] Constantine held a famous ecumenical gathering [01:03:06:08-01:03:08:20] known as the Council of Nicaea. [01:03:09:08-01:03:10:23] And at this council, [01:03:11:00-01:03:15:20] the many sects of Christianity debated and voted on, well, [01:03:15:21-01:03:20:04] everything, from the acceptance and rejection of specific gospels [01:03:20:06-01:03:21:18] to the date for Easter [01:03:21:20-01:03:24:19] to the administering of the sacraments, and of course, [01:03:24:21-01:03:27:01] the immortality of Jesus. [01:03:27:18-01:03:29:00] I don't follow. [01:03:29:11-01:03:32:08] Well, ma chère, until that moment in history, [01:03:32:10-01:03:37:06] Jesus was viewed by many of his followers as a mighty prophet, [01:03:37:08-01:03:41:04] as a great and powerful man, but a man nevertheless. [01:03:41:14-01:03:43:10] A mortal man. [01:03:43:15-01:03:44:21] Not the Son of God? [01:03:45:00-01:03:47:15] Not even his nephew twice removed. [01:03:47:17-01:03:51:13] Constantine did not create Jesus' divinity. [01:03:51:15-01:03:55:14] He simply sanctioned an already widely held idea. [01:03:55:16-01:03:57:12] Semantics. No, it's not semantics. [01:03:57:14-01:04:00:18] You're interpreting facts to support your own conclusions. [01:04:00:20-01:04:05:15] Fact. For many Christians, Jesus was mortal one day and divine the next. [01:04:05:16-01:04:07:17] For some Christians, his divinity was enhanced. [01:04:07:19-01:04:10:08] Absurd. There was even a formal announcement of his promotion. [01:04:10:09-01:04:12:09] They couldn't even agree on the Nicene Creed! [01:04:12:11-01:04:15:20] Excuse me. Who is God, who is man? [01:04:20:13-01:04:23:10] How many have been murdered over this question? [01:04:24:06-01:04:27:08] As long as there has been a one true God, [01:04:27:10-01:04:29:14] there has been killing in his name. [01:04:38:03-01:04:40:18] Now let me show you the Grail. [01:04:43:08-01:04:46:12] I trust you recognize The Last Supper, [01:04:46:13-01:04:50:13] the great fresco by Leonardo da Vinci. [01:04:52:22-01:04:55:17] Now, my dear, if you would close your eyes. [01:04:55:18-01:04:57:14] Leigh, save us the parlor tricks. [01:04:58:05-01:05:00:13] You asked for my help, I recall. [01:05:00:14-01:05:03:06] Allow an old man his indulgences. [01:05:07:16-01:05:11:02] Now, mademoiselle, where is Jesus sitting? [01:05:11:16-01:05:13:12] In the middle. Good. [01:05:13:14-01:05:16:10] He and his disciples are breaking bread. [01:05:16:15-01:05:19:08] And what drink? [01:05:19:09-01:05:21:09] Wine. They drank wine. [01:05:21:11-01:05:23:21] Splendid. And one final question. [01:05:23:23-01:05:26:15] How many wineglasses are there on the table? [01:05:28:09-01:05:30:09] One? The Holy Grail? [01:05:30:11-01:05:31:11] Open your eyes. [01:05:34:10-01:05:36:02] No single cup. [01:05:36:15-01:05:37:21] No chalice. [01:05:38:02-01:05:40:19] Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it? [01:05:41:00-01:05:44:00] Considering both the Bible and standard Grail legend [01:05:44:02-01:05:48:08] celebrate this moment as the definitive arrival of the Holy Grail. [01:05:49:11-01:05:50:12] Hmm. [01:05:51:09-01:05:54:01] Now, Robert, you could be of help to us. [01:05:54:03-01:05:58:00] If you'd be so kind as to show us the symbols for man and woman, please. [01:05:58:05-01:06:01:22] Oh, no balloon animals. I can make a great duck. [01:06:04:23-01:06:09:06] This is the original icon for male. It's a rudimentary phallus. [01:06:09:07-01:06:11:14] Quite to the point. Yes, indeed. [01:06:11:15-01:06:13:17] This is known as the blade. [01:06:13:22-01:06:15:22] It represents aggression and manhood. [01:06:15:23-01:06:18:18] It's a symbol still used today in modern military uniforms. [01:06:18:20-01:06:23:03] Yes, the more penises you have, the higher your rank. Boys will be boys. [01:06:23:04-01:06:27:15] Now, as you would imagine, the female symbol is its exact opposite. [01:06:27:16-01:06:29:00] This is called the chalice. [01:06:29:02-01:06:34:06] And the chalice resembles a cup or vessel or, more importantly, [01:06:34:08-01:06:36:12] the shape of a woman's womb. [01:06:37:17-01:06:40:19] No, the Grail has never been a cup. [01:06:40:21-01:06:45:20] It is quite literally this ancient symbol of womanhood. [01:06:46:23-01:06:52:06] And in this case, a woman who carried a secret so powerful [01:06:52:07-01:06:56:15] that if revealed, it would devastate the very foundations of Christianity. [01:06:56:20-01:06:58:04] Wait, please. [01:06:58:05-01:07:02:19] You're saying the Holy Grail is a person? A woman? [01:07:03:16-01:07:07:15] And it turns out, she makes an appearance right there. [01:07:08:03-01:07:09:18] But they are all men. [01:07:10:01-01:07:11:08] Are they? [01:07:11:09-01:07:13:22] What about that figure on the right hand of our Lord, [01:07:14:00-01:07:16:17] seated in the place of honor, hmm? [01:07:17:13-01:07:19:09] Flowing red hair. [01:07:20:12-01:07:22:19] Folded feminine hands. [01:07:23:23-01:07:26:09] Hint of a bosom. No? [01:07:31:21-01:07:35:06] It's called scotoma. The mind sees what it chooses to see. [01:07:35:14-01:07:36:23] Who is she? [01:07:38:06-01:07:40:03] My dear, that's Mary Magdalene. [01:07:40:13-01:07:41:13] The prostitute? [01:07:42:13-01:07:44:00] She was no such thing. [01:07:44:09-01:07:49:00] Smeared by the Church in 591 Anno Domini, poor dear. [01:07:51:10-01:07:54:06] Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife. [01:08:01:07-01:08:03:09] This is an old wives' tale. [01:08:03:11-01:08:05:01] The original one, in fact. [01:08:05:03-01:08:07:05] There's virtually no empirical proof. [01:08:07:09-01:08:10:17] He knows as well as I do there's much evidence to support it. [01:08:10:19-01:08:12:11] Theories. There are theories. [01:08:12:13-01:08:15:16] Notice how Jesus and Mary are clothed. [01:08:17:05-01:08:19:09] Mirror images of each other. [01:08:19:11-01:08:22:02] The mind sees what it chooses to see. [01:08:22:03-01:08:24:18] And venturing into the even more bizarre, [01:08:24:19-01:08:28:16] notice how Jesus and Mary appear to be joined at the hip [01:08:28:19-01:08:30:10] and are leaning away from each other [01:08:30:11-01:08:35:01] as if to create a shape in the negative space between them. [01:08:36:01-01:08:39:09] Leonardo gives us the chalice. [01:08:41:22-01:08:44:11] Yes. Oh, and Robert, notice what happens [01:08:44:12-01:08:47:23] when these two figures change position. [01:08:48:17-01:08:51:05] Just because da Vinci painted it doesn't make it true. [01:08:52:05-01:08:54:02] No. But history, [01:08:54:12-01:08:56:07] she does make it true. [01:08:56:12-01:08:59:18] Now, listen to this. It's from the Gospel according to Philip. [01:08:59:22-01:09:00:22] Philip? [01:09:01:00-01:09:04:03] Yes, it was rejected at the Council of Nicaea [01:09:04:04-01:09:09:00] along with any other gospels that made Jesus appear human and not divine. [01:09:09:02-01:09:14:00] And the companion of the Savior is Mary Magdalene. [01:09:14:08-01:09:18:05] Christ loved her more than all the disciples [01:09:18:07-01:09:20:01] and used to kiss her on the... [01:09:20:02-01:09:22:08] But this says nothing of marriage. [01:09:22:09-01:09:26:08] Well, actually, um... Robert. [01:09:26:23-01:09:31:14] Actually, in those days, the word companion literally meant spouse. [01:09:31:19-01:09:36:06] And this is from the Gospel of Mary Magdalene herself. [01:09:36:11-01:09:39:03] She wrote a gospel? She may have. [01:09:39:07-01:09:42:06] Robert, will you fight fair? She may have. [01:09:42:11-01:09:46:10] And Peter said, 'Did he prefer her to us?' [01:09:47:09-01:09:48:19] And Levi answered, [01:09:48:20-01:09:52:23] 'Peter, I see you contending against a woman like an adversary. [01:09:53:04-01:09:57:15] If the Savior made her worthy, who are you, indeed, to reject her?' [01:09:57:20-01:10:02:10] Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus goes on to tell Mary Magdalene [01:10:02:12-01:10:06:08] that it's up to her to continue his Church. [01:10:07:10-01:10:10:03] Mary Magdalene, not Peter. [01:10:10:11-01:10:14:07] The Church was supposed to be carried on by a woman. [01:10:15:05-01:10:19:22] Few realize that Mary was descended from kings, just as her husband was. [01:10:20:12-01:10:25:17] Now, my dear, the word in French for Holy Grail. [01:10:27:05-01:10:30:11] From the Middle English Sangreal, [01:10:30:13-01:10:33:05] of the original Arthurian legend. [01:10:33:07-01:10:38:10] Now, as two words. Can you translate for our friend? [01:10:41:03-01:10:43:06] It means royal blood. [01:10:44:08-01:10:48:13] When the legend speaks of the chalice that held the blood of Christ, [01:10:48:23-01:10:54:06] it speaks in fact of the female womb that carried Jesus' royal bloodline. [01:10:55:10-01:10:58:05] But how could Christ have a bloodline unless... [01:10:58:06-01:11:01:02] Mary was pregnant at the time of the Crucifixion. [01:11:09:21-01:11:14:08] For her own safety and for that of Christ's unborn child, [01:11:14:10-01:11:17:11] she fled the Holy Land and came to France. [01:11:17:12-01:11:22:15] And here, it is said, she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah. [01:11:23:23-01:11:26:08] They know the child's name. [01:11:27:07-01:11:29:04] A little girl. Yes. [01:11:29:08-01:11:31:14] If that were true, it's adding insult to injury. [01:11:31:16-01:11:32:17] Why? [01:11:32:22-01:11:36:13] The pagans found transcendence through the joining of male to female. [01:11:36:18-01:11:38:11] People found God through sex? [01:11:38:16-01:11:41:15] In paganism, women were worshiped as a route to heaven, [01:11:41:17-01:11:44:13] but the modern Church has a monopoly on that [01:11:44:18-01:11:46:17] in salvation through Jesus Christ. [01:11:46:18-01:11:50:00] And he who keeps the keys to heaven rules the world. [01:11:50:03-01:11:52:11] Women, then, are a huge threat to the Church. [01:11:53:11-01:11:55:11] The Catholic Inquisition soon publishes [01:11:55:12-01:11:58:20] what may be the most bloodsoaked book in human history. [01:11:59:00-01:12:01:10] The Malleus Maleficarum. [01:12:02:12-01:12:04:10] The Witches' Hammer. [01:12:04:12-01:12:08:09] It instructed the clergy on how to locate, torture and kill [01:12:08:10-01:12:09:20] all freethinking women. [01:12:13:20-01:12:16:01] In three centuries of witch hunts, [01:12:16:11-01:12:20:07] 50,000 women are captured, burned alive at the stake. [01:12:20:09-01:12:23:00] Oh, at least that. Some say millions. [01:12:23:15-01:12:25:07] Imagine, then, Robert, [01:12:25:19-01:12:29:16] that Christ's throne might live on in a female child. [01:12:30:16-01:12:33:16] You asked what would be worth killing for. [01:12:34:07-01:12:37:20] Witness the greatest coverup in human history. [01:12:38:16-01:12:41:01] This is the secret that the Priory of Sion [01:12:41:02-01:12:43:12] has defended for over 20 centuries. [01:12:43:13-01:12:46:17] They are the guardians of the royal bloodline. [01:12:47:10-01:12:51:00] The keepers of the proof of our true past. [01:12:51:02-01:12:55:02] They are the protectors of the living descendants of Jesus Christ [01:12:57:05-01:12:58:23] and Mary Magdalene. [01:13:08:17-01:13:09:23] (ON INTERCOM) Sir Leigh? [01:13:10:18-01:13:14:01] Sometimes I wonder who is serving whom. [01:13:14:18-01:13:17:19] His sauces are not that fantastic. [01:13:20:05-01:13:21:19] Yes, can I help you? [01:13:21:21-01:13:23:22] Yes. They're on the news now. [01:13:26:22-01:13:30:09] Living descendants? Is it possible? [01:13:30:11-01:13:32:02] It's not impossible. [01:13:33:08-01:13:37:00] You have not been honest with me. Your pictures are on the television. [01:13:37:02-01:13:39:00] You are wanted for four murders! [01:13:39:10-01:13:41:15] That's why Vernet said, Killing spree. [01:13:41:16-01:13:45:11] You come into my home, playing on my passions for the Grail. [01:13:45:12-01:13:48:03] That's why he needed you, Sophie. You will leave my house! [01:13:48:05-01:13:50:05] Leigh, listen! No, I'm calling the police. [01:13:50:06-01:13:52:06] Jacques Saunière was her grandfather. [01:13:55:14-01:13:57:09] You're the obsessive Priory scholar, Leigh. [01:13:57:10-01:13:59:16] You still keep lists of who might be in the Priory? [01:14:00:21-01:14:03:17] I'll bet Jacques Saunière was on one of those lists. [01:14:05:15-01:14:08:03] He was on your list of who could be Grand Master, wasn't he? [01:14:08:11-01:14:11:01] What? I'll bet he was right at the top. [01:14:11:06-01:14:16:13] Consider. Four men murdered? The same number as the guardians. [01:14:16:15-01:14:19:21] What if the Priory was compromised, the other sénéchaux dead? [01:14:20:02-01:14:22:05] What if you yourself were dying, a Grand Master? [01:14:22:20-01:14:26:07] You'd have to pass the secret on to someone you could trust. [01:14:26:12-01:14:28:05] Someone outside the society. [01:14:28:10-01:14:33:01] Maybe someone whose training you had begun but never finished. [01:14:35:23-01:14:38:11] Robert, your ruse is pathetic. [01:14:39:15-01:14:40:23] Not really. [01:14:42:13-01:14:44:19] No, that's impossible. [01:14:47:22-01:14:49:13] Can that really... [01:14:51:23-01:14:53:06] Is it the keystone? [01:14:56:15-01:14:59:06] I'll even show it to you, Leigh. [01:14:59:08-01:15:01:12] Will you just tell us what the hell it's for? [01:15:19:10-01:15:21:03] Fache says to wait, so I wait. [01:15:21:08-01:15:25:11] What's Fache thinking? The truck is here. They're inside. [01:15:31:04-01:15:32:04] Oh... [01:15:34:06-01:15:35:09] Yes. [01:15:35:14-01:15:38:09] As the legend foretold, [01:15:40:04-01:15:42:11] It hides beneath the Rose. [01:15:42:13-01:15:44:03] Oh, my. [01:15:49:11-01:15:50:11] Oh! [01:15:51:01-01:15:52:12] Leigh. [01:15:55:22-01:15:57:09] Leigh? Hmm? [01:15:58:06-01:15:59:08] Please. [01:15:59:13-01:16:01:13] I'm sorry. Yes, of course. [01:16:03:22-01:16:05:23] Inside the keystone, [01:16:07:08-01:16:08:23] there'll be a map. [01:16:09:01-01:16:11:20] A map that will lead us to the Holy Grail. [01:16:15:18-01:16:18:17] To be trained by the Grand Master himself. [01:16:19:04-01:16:23:00] Did he pass down the fleurdelis? Is that how you found this? [01:16:25:13-01:16:28:13] And he must have sung you the riddle songs. [01:16:28:15-01:16:30:04] I know some of them. [01:16:39:10-01:16:41:06] Can you keep secrets? [01:16:42:21-01:16:45:18] Can you know a thing and never say it again? [01:16:46:19-01:16:47:21] And codes? [01:16:49:03-01:16:53:03] I imagine they lie down for you like lovers. [01:16:56:03-01:17:01:04] A sénéchal. A guardian of the Grail right here in my own home. [01:17:01:06-01:17:04:04] Tell him, please. I don't know any of this. [01:17:04:08-01:17:07:05] Leigh, it's not that simple. She doesn't... [01:17:08:18-01:17:10:00] Robert! [01:17:15:08-01:17:16:17] Do not move, woman. [01:17:20:23-01:17:21:23] Cripple. [01:17:24:08-01:17:25:21] Put the box on the table. [01:17:27:02-01:17:28:11] What, this trifle? [01:17:29:00-01:17:32:16] Well, perhaps we can make a financial arrangement. [01:17:33:04-01:17:36:05] Put the keystone on the table. [01:17:37:04-01:17:38:20] You will not succeed. [01:17:41:03-01:17:44:07] Only the worthy can unlock the stone. [01:18:13:16-01:18:16:01] Rip the gate down. [01:18:19:13-01:18:21:06] Well, well, my dear. [01:18:25:10-01:18:26:18] Sit down. [01:18:26:23-01:18:28:09] Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. [01:18:28:14-01:18:30:17] Are you? Yeah. [01:18:30:22-01:18:33:06] Yes, well, make yourself useful, you French fool. [01:18:33:07-01:18:35:11] Get something to restrain this monster. [01:18:40:15-01:18:42:05] Above the joint. [01:18:43:02-01:18:47:03] Fortunately, a dragon most easy to slay. [01:18:47:21-01:18:49:06] He's wearing a cilice. [01:18:50:01-01:18:52:06] A what? Well, look. [01:18:54:18-01:18:57:18] Inflicts pain so he can suffer as Christ suffered. [01:18:57:20-01:18:58:22] Opus Dei. [01:18:59:01-01:19:00:13] Fache is Opus Dei. [01:19:02:01-01:19:05:03] The policeman who's chasing us. He wears the cross in the world. [01:19:05:05-01:19:06:05] Robert. [01:19:09:04-01:19:12:11] Well, I must say, you two are anything but dull. [01:19:13:17-01:19:14:17] Leigh? [01:19:16:22-01:19:18:08] You want what's in this box? [01:19:20:00-01:19:21:21] We need a way out of here. [01:19:21:22-01:19:26:03] Well, actually, I do have a plane. [01:19:37:07-01:19:39:06] Robert! Where do we go? Come along. [01:19:39:07-01:19:41:03] In here. Come in. Over here. [01:19:41:08-01:19:43:19] Get the door. Hurry. [01:19:45:21-01:19:47:22] Over here. Over here. Sophie. [01:19:48:00-01:19:49:06] Watch out! [01:19:50:15-01:19:52:06] Be careful. [01:19:52:08-01:19:53:13] Come, Rem... [01:20:01:09-01:20:02:18] Shit. [01:20:05:19-01:20:06:20] Easy. [01:20:29:21-01:20:30:23] Jesus! [01:20:31:01-01:20:32:01] Apropos. [01:20:34:21-01:20:36:18] I can't imagine what your complaint is. [01:20:36:19-01:20:39:19] I'd be within my rights to shoot you and let you rot in my woods! [01:20:39:23-01:20:42:08] Put that away. We might need him. [01:20:43:03-01:20:44:07] Better. [01:20:51:06-01:20:52:21] Opus Dei. [01:20:53:20-01:20:56:12] What is it? A conservative Catholic sect. [01:20:56:13-01:20:58:12] Opus Dei is a prelature to the Vatican. [01:20:58:13-01:21:02:02] You're saying the Vatican is killing people for this box? [01:21:02:04-01:21:04:05] No, no, no. Not the Vatican [01:21:04:07-01:21:06:22] and not Opus Dei, but we are in the middle of a war. [01:21:07:00-01:21:09:14] And one that has been going on forever. [01:21:09:15-01:21:11:21] On the one side stands the Priory [01:21:11:22-01:21:14:19] and on the other an ancient group of despots [01:21:14:22-01:21:17:07] with members hidden in highranking positions [01:21:17:09-01:21:19:07] throughout the Church. [01:21:19:08-01:21:23:15] And this Council of Shadows tries to destroy proof of the bloodline. [01:21:23:17-01:21:27:00] And that throughout history, they seek out and kill [01:21:27:01-01:21:28:23] the living descendants of Jesus Christ. [01:21:29:00-01:21:30:20] That's insane. Is it? [01:21:32:13-01:21:33:17] What if the world discovers [01:21:33:18-01:21:36:22] that the greatest story ever told is actually a lie? [01:21:37:00-01:21:40:16] The Vatican faces a crisis of faith unprecedented. [01:21:41:10-01:21:44:01] I've got a signal now, sir. It's ringing. [01:21:45:20-01:21:50:07] Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got tired of the weather here in France [01:21:50:10-01:21:53:08] and could you make the plane ready for... [01:21:56:05-01:21:57:09] Zürich. [01:21:57:23-01:21:59:10] Yes. No, we love Zürich. [01:22:07:07-01:22:09:21] What the hell do you mean, you lost them? Collet. [01:22:11:23-01:22:13:10] You're the one who lost them. [01:22:13:19-01:22:15:05] You control every step of this investigation. [01:22:15:09-01:22:17:22] You don't let anybody breathe. [01:22:18:10-01:22:21:03] You're acting like you lost your mind. [01:22:24:12-01:22:27:09] What is it with these two birds? [01:22:31:11-01:22:34:08] Interpol just registered a new flight plan from Le Bourget. [01:22:35:04-01:22:38:11] Stay out of my way on this, Collet. [01:23:06:01-01:23:07:22] Did you kill Jacques Saunière? [01:23:11:08-01:23:13:09] Did you kill Jacques Saunière? [01:23:14:08-01:23:16:03] I am the messenger of God. [01:23:20:00-01:23:22:04] Did you kill my grandfather? [01:23:25:07-01:23:26:18] I am the messenger... [01:23:27:10-01:23:31:11] Each breath you take is a sin. [01:23:32:23-01:23:35:09] No shadow will be safe again. [01:23:35:14-01:23:40:08] For you will be hunted by angels. [01:23:41:18-01:23:43:17] You believe in God? [01:23:45:00-01:23:47:12] Your God doesn't forgive murderers. [01:23:51:01-01:23:52:21] He burns them. [01:24:04:02-01:24:05:02] Sophie. [01:24:31:17-01:24:33:10] The Teacher will be pleased. [01:24:33:11-01:24:35:19] What will you do once you have the Grail? [01:24:35:21-01:24:36:23] Destroy it. [01:24:37:00-01:24:40:15] The documents and the sarcophagus, of course. [01:24:42:07-01:24:43:17] And the heir? [01:24:47:12-01:24:51:00] Will you exercise the final edict? Spill his blood? [01:24:51:14-01:24:53:05] There will be no need. [01:24:53:06-01:24:58:02] Once the sarcophagus is destroyed, DNA testing will be impossible. [01:24:58:04-01:25:00:21] There is no way to prove a living bloodline. [01:25:01:14-01:25:03:06] But if you had to, [01:25:04:21-01:25:07:22] would you do as councils have done before us? [01:25:16:21-01:25:18:04] Christ... [01:25:22:22-01:25:27:05] Christ sacrificed his life for the betterment of humanity. [01:25:30:20-01:25:33:17] So, too, may be the fate of his seed. [01:25:40:21-01:25:42:16] I need the flight plan. [01:25:42:23-01:25:44:00] Ten minutes. [01:25:44:23-01:25:47:08] I asked you to get it for me. [01:25:48:11-01:25:50:10] I'm on break. [01:25:51:20-01:25:53:11] Come back in 10 minutes. [01:25:55:11-01:25:57:15] My nose! My nose! [01:25:58:04-01:25:59:15] The flight plan, please. [01:25:59:19-01:26:00:19] You asshole! [01:26:14:01-01:26:15:18] It's not cross. [01:26:17:00-01:26:18:07] Spear? [01:26:22:21-01:26:24:10] What happened to her? [01:26:25:05-01:26:26:20] No one knows. [01:26:27:04-01:26:30:12] Mary Magdalene lived out her days in hiding. [01:26:32:08-01:26:34:17] And the zealots pursued her still, [01:26:35:08-01:26:39:17] even in death, trying to destroy proof of her existence. [01:26:40:17-01:26:43:01] But she always had her Knights. [01:26:43:03-01:26:45:14] Brave men sworn to defend her. [01:26:45:21-01:26:48:10] You see, to worship before her sarcophagus, [01:26:48:22-01:26:52:08] to kneel before the bones of Mary Magdalene, [01:26:52:10-01:26:55:17] was to remember all those who were robbed of their power, [01:26:55:19-01:26:56:19] who were oppressed. [01:26:57:04-01:27:01:18] Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains and the proof of her bloodline [01:27:01:20-01:27:04:11] until most believed her sarcophagus, [01:27:05:11-01:27:07:03] the Holy Grail, [01:27:08:03-01:27:11:02] was finally lost in time. [01:27:22:01-01:27:23:01] What are you doing? [01:27:23:03-01:27:25:19] At the chateau, you said, It hides beneath the Rose. [01:27:25:21-01:27:27:08] No, no, no. Do be careful. [01:27:27:15-01:27:32:16] In Latin, sub rosa. Literal translation. Beneath the rose. [01:27:46:01-01:27:47:13] We need a mirror. [01:27:47:17-01:27:50:14] Backwards. In the style of Leonardo himself. [01:27:50:18-01:27:51:22] Thank you. [01:27:56:19-01:28:00:18] In London lies a knight a Pope interred [01:28:00:23-01:28:04:15] His labor's fruit a Holy wrath incurred [01:28:05:01-01:28:08:00] You seek the orb that ought be on his tomb [01:28:08:09-01:28:12:00] It speaks of Rosy flesh and seeded womb [01:28:12:05-01:28:16:04] In London lies a knight a Pope interred? [01:28:16:09-01:28:20:04] A knight whose funeral was presided over by the Pope. [01:28:20:09-01:28:23:17] Of course, the Priory knights were not just any knights. [01:28:23:18-01:28:24:21] Templars. [01:28:24:22-01:28:28:01] And there's just one place to bury a Templar knight in London. [01:28:28:02-01:28:29:06] Temple Church. [01:28:29:07-01:28:31:11] Temple Church. If you'll excuse me, my dear, [01:28:31:14-01:28:34:10] Roger and I must discuss a change in flight plan. [01:28:34:23-01:28:36:07] Leigh. [01:28:38:01-01:28:40:11] Harboring and transporting fugitives? [01:28:41:05-01:28:43:19] You are already implicated enough. [01:28:45:00-01:28:48:14] You and I, Robert, have observed history. [01:28:48:19-01:28:50:14] Time has been our glass. [01:28:51:14-01:28:54:19] We are in history now. Living it. [01:28:56:12-01:28:58:03] Making it. [01:28:58:20-01:29:00:10] (CHUCKLES) Implicated? [01:29:00:12-01:29:03:01] I am on a Grail quest. [01:29:04:16-01:29:06:07] Forgive me, Robert, [01:29:06:09-01:29:08:19] but you two may well have given this old man [01:29:08:21-01:29:11:05] the greatest night of his life. [01:29:13:02-01:29:14:05] Thank you. [01:29:16:08-01:29:18:11] He's going to want more money. [01:29:35:14-01:29:39:18] I suppose this is a new technique for investigations. [01:29:39:22-01:29:45:01] I've lost them. They flew to Switzerland. [01:29:45:07-01:29:47:12] No extradition. [01:29:50:06-01:29:56:10] The controller filed charges. Ari was on dispatch. He called me. [01:30:00:15-01:30:03:18] What's going on, Bezu? [01:30:06:18-01:30:09:14] You know that I am Opus Dei? [01:30:09:23-01:30:11:13] Yes. [01:30:16:19-01:30:20:08] A bishop of my order called me. [01:30:20:16-01:30:22:19] He said a killer came to him in confession. [01:30:22:23-01:30:25:17] His name was Robert Langdon. [01:30:26:21-01:30:30:01] He said I couldn't imagine the evil in this man's heart. [01:30:30:05-01:30:32:22] That he would keep killing. [01:30:33:07-01:30:35:18] He said I had to stop him. [01:30:37:19-01:30:41:15] The bishop broke his vows to tell me this. [01:30:41:19-01:30:45:06] He charged me to stop Robert Langdon. [01:30:48:04-01:30:52:23] Tell me, Collet, who have I failed? [01:30:53:18-01:30:55:13] The bishop? [01:30:56:20-01:30:58:23] God himself? [01:31:07:14-01:31:10:17] They've changed their flight plan to London. [01:31:39:09-01:31:43:03] I have them, tower. Relay Hawker to land and hold on tarmac. [01:32:40:10-01:32:42:15] Secure the area! Wider! [01:32:42:20-01:32:44:22] Armed police! You two, round the back! [01:32:45:07-01:32:48:12] Armed police! Put your hands in the air! [01:32:48:17-01:32:50:11] Three men up! Ready! [01:32:50:14-01:32:52:21] Put your hands in the air! Do it now! [01:32:53:15-01:32:56:01] I'm afraid that's easier said than done in my case. [01:32:58:03-01:32:59:10] Oh, good morning. [01:32:59:11-01:33:02:14] Did that old cannabis charge finally catch up with me? [01:33:02:16-01:33:05:12] Sir, the French police say you're transporting fugitives, [01:33:05:14-01:33:07:08] and you may have a hostage onboard. [01:33:07:10-01:33:08:21] I'm to take you all into custody. [01:33:08:23-01:33:11:12] Sadly, I have an important medical appointment [01:33:11:13-01:33:12:18] which I can't afford to miss. [01:33:12:20-01:33:14:01] I'll fetch the car, sir. [01:33:14:03-01:33:16:23] This is serious, sir. The French police are on their way. Stop! [01:33:17:17-01:33:20:21] Inspector, I can't afford the time to indulge your games. [01:33:20:22-01:33:22:07] I'm late and I'm leaving. [01:33:22:10-01:33:24:10] If it's so important for you to stop us, [01:33:24:12-01:33:26:18] then you're just going to have to shoot us. [01:33:27:12-01:33:28:22] You can start with him. [01:33:34:06-01:33:35:15] Search the plane. [01:33:36:07-01:33:37:13] All right. [01:33:49:18-01:33:51:10] I could run them over. [01:33:56:21-01:33:57:21] Bad tip. [01:33:59:20-01:34:01:05] Let him go. [01:34:05:19-01:34:08:04] The French cannot be trusted. [01:34:16:23-01:34:18:00] Everyone comfy? [01:34:20:11-01:34:21:12] Biscuits? [01:34:22:00-01:34:23:11] They didn't notice anything? [01:34:24:01-01:34:28:06] Well, people rarely notice things right in front of their eyes, don't you find? [01:34:42:11-01:34:45:01] Do you have the bonds, bishop? [01:34:45:06-01:34:46:12] Yes, I do, Teacher. [01:34:46:16-01:34:50:00] I have chosen an Opus Dei residence for the exchange. [01:34:50:04-01:34:51:16] I am honored. [01:34:51:21-01:34:56:17] By the time you get to London, I will have the Grail. [01:35:02:02-01:35:06:23] Remember, if we are discovered by the Vatican, we are excommunicated. [01:35:07:01-01:35:10:01] So should anything go wrong... Yes, I know, I know. [01:35:11:11-01:35:13:03] This council does not exist. [01:35:14:03-01:35:15:20] As it never has. [01:35:18:17-01:35:22:11] Old friend. Heaven protect you. [01:35:29:23-01:35:31:22] Keep an eye out for the police. [01:35:45:02-01:35:47:20] I must say, Robert, I'm quite impressed [01:35:47:22-01:35:51:04] by the way you withstood my little airplane. [01:35:52:20-01:35:54:12] Did he never tell you? [01:35:54:13-01:35:58:00] When he was a boy, young Robert fell into a well. [01:35:58:01-01:35:59:20] How old were you? [01:35:59:21-01:36:01:01] Seven. [01:36:03:17-01:36:07:02] Treading water all night long, screaming his lungs out [01:36:07:04-01:36:09:03] to the echoes screaming back. [01:36:09:05-01:36:11:18] When they found him, he was nearly catatonic. [01:36:11:22-01:36:13:00] Help! [01:36:14:02-01:36:15:13] It was a long time ago. [01:36:15:14-01:36:17:12] Oh, now, now, Robert. [01:36:17:14-01:36:21:20] You, above all people, shouldn't be one to dismiss the influence of the past. [01:36:27:14-01:36:31:20] Tell me, why has the Priory kept the Grail location secret all these years? [01:36:31:21-01:36:32:21] I don't know. [01:36:33:10-01:36:36:05] Some say the Priory wait for the heir to reveal himself, [01:36:36:06-01:36:38:01] which is especially odd [01:36:38:05-01:36:41:14] since legend suggests he may not know his own true identity. [01:36:49:13-01:36:50:13] Hello? [01:36:51:08-01:36:53:23] Why do they make them so scary? [01:36:59:15-01:37:00:17] Oh, it's cold. [01:37:00:22-01:37:04:05] In London lies a knight a Pope interred. [01:37:13:13-01:37:16:22] So which tomb has an orb? [01:37:19:06-01:37:22:15] Two wear tunics over their armor [01:37:22:17-01:37:25:20] and, uh, two have fulllength robes. [01:37:26:22-01:37:28:15] Two are grasping swords. [01:37:29:03-01:37:32:17] And one... Two are praying. [01:37:34:16-01:37:36:19] This one has his arms at his sides. [01:37:36:20-01:37:40:13] Oh, and this poor fellow has almost disappeared entirely. [01:37:40:17-01:37:45:10] I don't see any orb that ought be on a tomb. [01:37:46:08-01:37:49:05] Ought be on his tomb. Are we looking for a missing orb? [01:37:49:06-01:37:51:03] Maybe. Over here, see. [01:37:56:04-01:37:57:21] These aren't tombs. [01:37:57:23-01:38:00:11] What? Yes, of course they are. No. [01:38:00:12-01:38:02:15] They're effigies. What? [01:38:02:17-01:38:04:19] Not tombs. There's no bodies here. [01:38:04:23-01:38:06:10] This place is wrong. [01:38:08:11-01:38:11:19] Can we go now? We should go. [01:38:15:00-01:38:16:11] Sophie! No! [01:38:18:10-01:38:19:21] Where is the keystone? [01:38:21:00-01:38:22:06] Do not test me! [01:38:22:08-01:38:23:14] Let her go! Don't you hurt her. [01:38:23:17-01:38:25:19] Give me the keystone! Give it to me! Can you stop that? [01:38:25:21-01:38:27:15] Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is. [01:38:27:17-01:38:30:22] Just let her go, and you and I can... We'll come to some agreement. [01:38:32:05-01:38:33:15] Remy. [01:38:37:00-01:38:39:13] Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away. [01:38:40:20-01:38:43:04] Put it away. They're too close together. You don't have a clear shot. [01:38:44:07-01:38:46:16] Yes, I do. Stop that. What do you think you're doing? [01:38:48:22-01:38:53:08] Thank you, Professor. For a moment, this was getting complicated. [01:38:53:09-01:38:55:11] This is absurd. Oh, for God's sake, man! [01:38:58:22-01:39:01:04] That was satisfying. [01:39:01:06-01:39:03:02] I'm glad this bullshit is over. [01:39:06:08-01:39:08:02] Throw Teabing in the trunk. [01:39:08:07-01:39:09:12] What? [01:39:14:23-01:39:16:12] Here. You okay? [01:39:22:09-01:39:23:09] Sorry. [01:40:04:10-01:40:06:05] I don't think he's following. [01:40:14:10-01:40:18:07] They won't kill Leigh until they find the Grail. [01:40:20:10-01:40:23:16] So we have to find it before they do. I have to get to a library, fast. [01:40:31:14-01:40:35:22] He once whined to me about the wasted space of so large a trunk. [01:40:37:00-01:40:39:03] Let's see if he complains so now. [01:40:40:05-01:40:42:03] Are you the Teacher? [01:40:45:09-01:40:46:10] I am. [01:40:48:05-01:40:52:17] Superbly done. You've been of great service. [01:40:56:05-01:40:59:06] The cryptex has yet to be opened. I can still serve. [01:40:59:08-01:41:01:11] You've done enough. [01:41:04:13-01:41:08:05] We cannot let ego deter us from our goal. [01:41:09:10-01:41:11:10] I understand. [01:41:12:10-01:41:13:13] Good. [01:41:16:18-01:41:21:15] Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei, and you will be rewarded. [01:41:21:17-01:41:23:22] I will dispose of the old man. [01:41:25:02-01:41:26:17] Bless you, Silas. [01:41:28:18-01:41:30:00] Teacher. [01:41:38:05-01:41:39:22] Christ be with you. [01:41:42:16-01:41:47:13] We're at least a halfhour to Chelsea Library. [01:41:48:02-01:41:50:03] If we're gonna help Leigh, that's too long. [01:42:01:20-01:42:03:09] Where are you going? [01:42:03:11-01:42:05:14] Getting you a library card. [01:42:09:05-01:42:11:09] Excuse me. May I sit next to you? [01:42:11:10-01:42:13:22] Yeah, sure. Thank you. [01:42:22:11-01:42:23:18] That's great. [01:42:24:17-01:42:26:22] Didn't say you had a boyfriend. [01:42:29:15-01:42:30:22] Thanks. [01:42:31:13-01:42:33:22] Let's see if we can access the database on this. [01:42:35:05-01:42:38:14] In London lies a knight a Pope interred. [01:42:38:16-01:42:40:10] Compounding keywords. [01:42:40:15-01:42:43:12] Knight, Pope, Grail. [01:42:44:03-01:42:48:03] Your precious treasure was almost lost, and with it, my fortune. [01:42:52:13-01:42:54:19] Can you believe how well I did? [01:42:56:09-01:42:58:12] I even convinced the monk. [01:42:59:09-01:43:01:07] I should be in theater. [01:43:08:00-01:43:11:00] A toast to our success, Teacher. [01:43:11:02-01:43:13:12] The end of the journey is near. [01:43:16:01-01:43:19:09] Your identity shall go with me to the grave. [01:43:24:19-01:43:28:10] There's your problem, mate. It's your basic linguistic coincidence. [01:43:28:21-01:43:31:03] See, keywords keep coming up with the writings [01:43:31:05-01:43:34:07] of some bloke named Alexander Pope. [01:43:34:08-01:43:35:14] A. Pope. [01:43:37:05-01:43:39:00] Your grandfather was a genius. [01:43:43:21-01:43:44:22] Come on. [01:44:19:14-01:44:21:10] Emergency. Which service do you require? [01:44:21:12-01:44:26:14] I know the location of two murderers wanted by French police. [01:44:30:12-01:44:32:18] We've just had a 999 call. [01:44:32:19-01:44:35:06] Triangulation leads back to Docklands. [01:44:35:08-01:44:37:13] Caller was male. Claimed your two murderers [01:44:37:15-01:44:40:05] are hiding at an Opus Dei house. [01:44:49:08-01:44:53:11] The knight we're looking for is Sir Isaac Newton. [01:44:55:00-01:44:58:17] His life's work produced new sciences that incurred the wrath of the Church. [01:44:59:05-01:45:01:11] Gravity, for God sakes. [01:45:02:20-01:45:06:01] And if you choose to believe, [01:45:06:02-01:45:10:06] he was also a Grand Master of the Priory as well. [01:45:21:05-01:45:23:17] But if he offended the Catholic Church, [01:45:23:19-01:45:27:16] the Pope would be the last person to preside over his funeral. [01:45:27:17-01:45:30:05] Well, that's where I got it wrong. [01:45:30:06-01:45:33:10] In London lies a knight a Pope interred. [01:45:33:12-01:45:36:07] Sir Isaac Newton's funeral was presided over [01:45:36:09-01:45:40:12] by his good friend, his colleague, Alexander Pope. [01:45:40:14-01:45:43:02] A. Pope. His first initial. [01:45:43:04-01:45:44:16] How did I miss that? [01:45:45:11-01:45:46:11] Here. [01:45:46:13-01:45:49:16] Yes. Isaac Newton's tomb. [01:45:50:23-01:45:52:08] An orb. (SIGHS) [01:45:52:09-01:45:54:01] Yes. Which one? [01:45:54:21-01:45:57:12] It's not possible to tell if a particular orb is missing. [01:45:57:13-01:46:01:05] An orb with Rosy flesh and seeded womb. [01:46:01:06-01:46:03:09] Solar system. The planets. [01:46:03:10-01:46:05:22] Constellations. Signs of the zodiac. [01:46:06:13-01:46:08:17] See, our moon is missing. [01:46:08:19-01:46:11:04] The moons of Saturn and Jupiter. They're not here. [01:46:12:02-01:46:14:06] Eyes of the cherubs themselves? [01:46:16:14-01:46:19:03] Robert. These tracks. [01:46:20:06-01:46:22:13] (WHISPERING) Look at the cane marks in the dust. [01:46:25:18-01:46:27:04] Teabing was here. [01:46:28:13-01:46:29:19] He was alone. [01:46:31:15-01:46:35:17] When the two of you arrived at my home as you did, [01:46:36:22-01:46:39:10] others might call it God's will. [01:46:40:17-01:46:43:05] I believed that if I had the cryptex [01:46:43:07-01:46:45:18] I could solve the riddle alone. [01:46:47:11-01:46:49:04] But I was unworthy. [01:46:49:06-01:46:50:07] But you... [01:46:51:06-01:46:53:19] You have a reason to be here. [01:46:53:21-01:46:57:02] You're the last remaining guardian of the Grail. [01:46:57:20-01:47:00:01] Your grandfather and the other sénéchaux [01:47:00:03-01:47:02:01] would not have lied with dying breath [01:47:02:03-01:47:04:23] unless they knew their secret was preserved. [01:47:07:14-01:47:10:06] How could you know Saunière's last words? [01:47:10:08-01:47:11:09] Leigh. [01:47:12:12-01:47:14:18] Grail quests require sacrifice. [01:47:15:10-01:47:16:20] You are a murderer. [01:47:16:22-01:47:20:04] No. No. Robert, tell her. [01:47:20:06-01:47:24:01] When history is written, murderers are heroes. [01:47:26:04-01:47:28:05] You selfrighteous bastard! [01:47:28:07-01:47:29:17] We... We need to just walk away. [01:47:29:19-01:47:31:14] No, don't. Don't. Walk away. [01:47:35:00-01:47:36:12] I'll do what I have to now. [01:47:41:21-01:47:43:01] Anything. [01:47:47:05-01:47:48:15] Do you understand? [01:47:50:08-01:47:51:17] So now, [01:47:53:05-01:47:55:06] can't we all be friends again? [01:47:56:13-01:47:57:20] This way. [01:48:34:03-01:48:37:22] I'm going to put this gun down. I only want you both to listen. [01:48:39:19-01:48:40:23] I'm listening now. [01:48:41:11-01:48:42:22] For 2000 years [01:48:43:15-01:48:47:12] the Church has rained oppression and atrocity upon mankind, [01:48:48:04-01:48:53:02] crushed passion and idea alike, all in the name of their walking God. [01:48:53:13-01:48:57:22] Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring an end to all that suffering, [01:48:58:10-01:49:00:14] drive this church of lies to its knees. [01:49:02:21-01:49:04:19] Armed police! Ahh! [01:49:04:20-01:49:05:22] Drop your weapon! [01:49:09:16-01:49:12:02] Stop, Silas! [01:49:23:11-01:49:26:07] We are betrayed, my son. [01:49:27:07-01:49:29:10] The living heir must be revealed. [01:49:30:10-01:49:32:17] Jesus must be shown for what he was. [01:49:32:18-01:49:35:16] Not miraculous, simply man. [01:49:37:03-01:49:38:07] I'm sorry. [01:49:40:19-01:49:41:21] Armed police! [01:49:42:08-01:49:45:11] Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it! [01:49:55:02-01:49:57:17] Put it down now! Put it down! [01:50:05:10-01:50:07:12] I am a ghost. [01:50:08:14-01:50:11:09] The dark con can be exposed. [01:50:11:11-01:50:16:10] Mankind can finally be set free, and we can do it, Robert. [01:50:18:00-01:50:19:08] The three of us. [01:50:37:11-01:50:38:17] How is Silas? [01:50:39:02-01:50:41:10] Is he... Is he alive? [01:50:41:21-01:50:42:22] The monk? [01:50:46:11-01:50:49:10] Bishop, how would you know this killer's name? [01:50:49:22-01:50:52:12] (PANTING) Get me out of here, Fache. [01:50:53:03-01:50:54:06] Wait. [01:50:57:16-01:51:00:18] Langdon never came to you in confession, did he? [01:51:01:10-01:51:05:07] One of your followers called you about the crimescene photos. [01:51:06:13-01:51:08:05] I cannot be implicated here. [01:51:09:12-01:51:11:15] There are still important works to be done. [01:51:13:06-01:51:14:14] You used me. [01:51:16:12-01:51:18:13] God uses us all. [01:51:19:08-01:51:20:21] Help me, Fache. [01:51:22:01-01:51:23:04] Take him. [01:51:27:22-01:51:29:18] Did you get his cell phone? Yes, sir. [01:51:29:20-01:51:31:21] I'm going to need a trace. [01:51:34:18-01:51:36:15] Your Silas is dead. [01:51:43:17-01:51:45:15] The Priory's sacred charge [01:51:45:17-01:51:48:18] was to reveal the heir at the dawn of the new millennium. [01:51:49:16-01:51:54:23] The millennium came and went and the living heir remained hidden. (CHUCKLES) [01:51:55:00-01:51:58:11] The Priory failed in their sacred charge. [01:51:59:17-01:52:01:18] So, what choice did I have? [01:52:06:00-01:52:07:20] I sought out the enemy. [01:52:09:07-01:52:13:06] I persuaded them, the Council of Shadows, that I was an ally. [01:52:14:06-01:52:17:14] I even asked them for money so they would never suspect me. [01:52:18:10-01:52:21:00] Rector, I made them call me. [01:52:21:22-01:52:23:02] Teacher. [01:52:23:04-01:52:24:12] Why don't you and l... No. [01:52:24:14-01:52:27:03] Robert, no words. On your knees. [01:52:27:17-01:52:29:03] Do it. [01:52:29:04-01:52:30:19] No, I mean it. Down. [01:52:31:20-01:52:34:16] Not you. No, my dear, you. [01:52:37:07-01:52:39:09] You're my miracle, Sophie. [01:52:40:08-01:52:42:19] You're the guardian of the Grail. [01:52:43:19-01:52:47:10] All the oppression of the poor and the powerless [01:52:47:12-01:52:50:12] of those of different skin, of women. [01:52:50:14-01:52:53:06] You can put an end to all that. [01:52:54:00-01:52:57:05] You must explode the truth onto the world. [01:52:58:12-01:52:59:23] It's your duty. [01:53:02:22-01:53:05:07] You know the answer to this riddle. [01:53:07:03-01:53:08:16] Open the cryptex, [01:53:10:06-01:53:11:23] and I'll put down the gun. [01:53:30:02-01:53:32:05] I have no idea how. [01:53:32:07-01:53:34:07] I don't know the code. [01:53:34:08-01:53:36:21] And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you. [01:53:42:16-01:53:44:13] Like your grandfather, then. [01:53:45:16-01:53:48:05] Willing to die for your secret. [01:53:49:21-01:53:52:19] But, by the way you've been looking at your hero, [01:53:53:14-01:53:57:22] I wonder, would you let him die for you? [01:53:58:15-01:54:01:00] Open it, Sophie, to save his life. [01:54:01:02-01:54:03:06] Leigh, you can't just... Open the cryptex. [01:54:03:22-01:54:05:00] I don't know how. [01:54:05:02-01:54:07:03] Open it or he dies. [01:54:07:05-01:54:09:07] I swear, I don't know. Do it! Do it! [01:54:09:09-01:54:10:17] Stop it! I don't know! [01:54:10:19-01:54:12:03] Stop it! [01:54:17:22-01:54:19:22] She can't do it, Leigh. [01:54:31:16-01:54:33:13] But give... Give me a moment. [01:54:43:17-01:54:45:02] Robert. [01:54:58:15-01:54:59:15] What are you doing? [01:54:59:17-01:55:01:13] (SHUSHES) Please. [01:56:21:19-01:56:23:05] I'm sorry. [01:56:33:10-01:56:34:14] I'm sorry. [01:56:37:09-01:56:38:09] No! [01:56:46:22-01:56:48:06] No, Robert! [01:56:49:00-01:56:50:06] No! [01:56:51:11-01:56:52:11] No. [01:56:52:17-01:56:54:22] The map. It's ruined. [01:57:02:10-01:57:03:21] The map is ruined. [01:57:03:23-01:57:06:05] (STAMMERS) The Grail. [01:57:06:17-01:57:07:20] It's lost. [01:57:08:13-01:57:10:01] The Grail is gone. [01:57:10:09-01:57:13:03] Only the worthy find the Grail, Leigh. [01:57:14:05-01:57:15:19] You taught me that. [01:57:19:00-01:57:20:14] Armed police! [01:57:20:15-01:57:22:03] Drop it! Drop your weapon! [01:57:23:06-01:57:24:08] Put the gun down. [01:57:27:10-01:57:29:18] Put the gun down. [01:57:34:12-01:57:37:12] That one. The old man. [01:57:37:13-01:57:38:14] You're under arrest! [01:57:38:16-01:57:41:01] You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defense [01:57:41:02-01:57:43:03] if you do not mention, when questioned [01:57:43:05-01:57:45:08] something which you later rely on in court. [01:57:45:09-01:57:48:02] Anything you do say will be given in evidence. [01:57:58:18-01:58:01:01] I'll have some questions for you. [01:58:18:17-01:58:20:17] Robert! Robert! [01:58:20:19-01:58:22:16] Robert! How could you do it? [01:58:22:17-01:58:24:14] How could you? Robert! [01:58:25:06-01:58:27:14] To destroy our hope of freedom. [01:58:27:23-01:58:31:14] To deny every pilgrim the chance to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene. [01:58:31:15-01:58:32:15] How could you? [01:58:37:09-01:58:39:07] You couldn't! You solved it. [01:58:41:19-01:58:45:14] You took the scroll out before it broke! [01:58:45:16-01:58:47:22] You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert. [01:58:48:00-01:58:49:15] You'll find it. You know what to do. [01:58:49:17-01:58:52:00] You'll find the Grail, you'll kneel before her, [01:58:52:01-01:58:54:04] and you'll set her free upon the world! [01:58:54:05-01:58:57:08] That man there, he's got the map to the Holy Grail! [01:59:08:05-01:59:12:18] There was every orb conceivable on that tomb except one. [01:59:14:00-01:59:16:09] The orb which fell from the heavens [01:59:16:11-01:59:18:03] and inspired Newton's life's work. [01:59:18:04-01:59:23:07] Work that incurred the wrath of the Church until his dying day. [01:59:29:02-01:59:30:07] Apple. [01:59:44:23-01:59:48:01] The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits. [01:59:48:03-01:59:50:12] The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates [01:59:50:13-01:59:52:13] Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies [01:59:52:15-01:59:56:09] She rests at last beneath the starry skies [01:59:58:11-02:00:00:09] I think I know where she's gone. [02:00:01:07-02:00:03:19] I think the Grail has gone home. [02:00:23:16-02:00:26:04] Built by the Templars themselves. [02:00:26:06-02:00:28:15] Named for the original Rose Line. [02:00:28:17-02:00:30:13] Rosslyn Chapel. [02:00:31:17-02:00:33:12] So this is it. [02:00:34:12-02:00:36:09] The gift at the end. [02:00:37:08-02:00:41:02] The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits. [02:00:42:00-02:00:44:18] You never told me the joke Saunière made of you. [02:00:45:11-02:00:47:04] What was it? [02:00:47:06-02:00:49:11] He called me a flatfoot. [02:00:49:13-02:00:51:11] A beat cop of history. [02:00:52:13-02:00:54:04] A dumb policeman, [02:00:54:20-02:00:58:08] who just does his job day after day, of history. [02:00:58:10-02:01:00:03] You know, his father was one. [02:01:00:20-02:01:02:18] A policeman. [02:01:02:20-02:01:07:13] Saunière said he was the most honorable man he had ever known. [02:01:11:10-02:01:14:02] We are who we protect, I think. [02:01:14:23-02:01:16:17] What we stand up for. [02:01:28:16-02:01:30:02] Jewish. [02:01:31:04-02:01:33:22] Christian, Egyptian. [02:01:35:05-02:01:37:15] Masonic, pagan. [02:01:38:17-02:01:40:10] Templar crosses. [02:01:41:01-02:01:42:10] Pyramids. [02:01:43:04-02:01:47:02] I think I've been here before. [02:01:47:03-02:01:48:08] Sophie? [02:02:08:04-02:02:09:21] A very long time ago. [02:02:12:06-02:02:14:01] Come along, Sophie. [02:02:29:06-02:02:30:07] Sophie. [02:02:31:08-02:02:32:11] Over here. [02:02:38:15-02:02:39:16] Oh. [02:02:40:05-02:02:43:19] The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates. [02:02:44:07-02:02:46:18] Pagan symbols for male and female. [02:02:48:15-02:02:50:18] Fused as one. [02:02:50:20-02:02:52:22] As the pagans would have wanted. [02:02:54:17-02:02:56:10] We're about to close, I'm afraid. [02:03:02:16-02:03:05:00] We're just gonna be a moment. [02:03:19:21-02:03:21:04] Robert. [02:03:47:06-02:03:50:10] Adorned in masters' loving art, she lies. [02:03:50:12-02:03:55:22] She rests at last beneath the starry skies. [02:04:15:12-02:04:17:05] The fleurdelis. [02:05:08:07-02:05:09:09] She was here. [02:05:12:10-02:05:13:23] Her sarcophagus. [02:05:16:01-02:05:17:15] Mary Magdalene. [02:05:19:10-02:05:21:08] The Holy Grail herself. [02:05:23:00-02:05:24:16] She was here. [02:05:24:17-02:05:26:08] Where did she go? [02:05:27:11-02:05:29:20] Did the Church finally get her? [02:05:44:08-02:05:47:02] This is incredible. Look at this. [02:05:47:03-02:05:50:11] Look at this. These records go back thousands of years. [02:05:51:15-02:05:54:04] They date back to the death of Christ. [02:05:56:19-02:06:00:04] Good God, could these really be the Grail documents? [02:06:22:05-02:06:26:02] What did he want from us? To find her sarcophagus? [02:06:27:14-02:06:30:06] How was I ever supposed to figure all this out? [02:06:30:15-02:06:33:00] When you and your grandfather fought, [02:06:33:02-02:06:35:19] was it something about your past? [02:06:37:18-02:06:39:13] How could you know that? [02:06:40:04-02:06:42:21] About how your parents died? [02:06:43:23-02:06:45:12] Sophie? [02:06:47:22-02:06:50:03] It was during primary school. [02:06:51:18-02:06:53:18] I was in his library. [02:06:55:13-02:06:57:05] Doing research. [02:06:57:07-02:06:59:22] I was trying to find out about my family. [02:07:00:02-02:07:02:08] Sophie, where are you, princess? [02:07:03:04-02:07:05:11] I wanted to know about them. [02:07:06:06-02:07:08:05] But I couldn't find any records. [02:07:09:08-02:07:11:05] Not of their death, [02:07:12:17-02:07:14:11] not of the accident. [02:07:15:10-02:07:17:22] I'd asked him for as long as I could remember, [02:07:18:00-02:07:19:04] but he would never tell me. [02:07:19:06-02:07:20:23] I told you, no. [02:07:23:10-02:07:24:21] But why can't I? [02:07:25:05-02:07:27:01] He stood over me, [02:07:28:19-02:07:30:19] and he wouldn't let me leave. [02:07:31:00-02:07:32:20] They're dead. Dead and buried. [02:07:33:08-02:07:35:00] Never look for them, Sophie. [02:07:35:07-02:07:36:12] Promise me. [02:07:37:23-02:07:39:01] Swear it! [02:07:39:19-02:07:40:22] Swear it to me! [02:07:51:14-02:07:53:13] I kept my promise. [02:07:57:04-02:07:59:11] The next week he sent me to boarding school. [02:08:01:16-02:08:04:15] One weekend, I came home unexpectedly. [02:08:06:06-02:08:08:08] And what I saw my grandfather doing... [02:08:10:00-02:08:11:14] Some ritual. [02:08:13:14-02:08:15:05] I was so frightened. [02:08:19:21-02:08:22:01] We hardly ever spoke again. [02:08:25:16-02:08:27:06] Do you have any... [02:08:28:02-02:08:30:18] Any memories of your grandfather before the accident? [02:08:31:21-02:08:33:15] Before your parents were killed? [02:08:34:13-02:08:37:07] (SIGHS) Yeah. No, I don't know. [02:08:38:11-02:08:39:15] Why? [02:08:42:09-02:08:44:18] Because I don't think he was your grandfather. [02:09:04:06-02:09:05:22] These are my parents. [02:09:08:06-02:09:09:14] My brother. [02:09:11:10-02:09:13:05] And this is you, isn't it? [02:09:18:04-02:09:21:20] The paper says the entire family was killed. [02:09:22:08-02:09:25:17] The mother, the father, the boy, six. [02:09:27:22-02:09:30:03] And the girl, four. [02:09:31:20-02:09:34:22] But your name was never Saunière. [02:09:35:00-02:09:36:14] It's SaintClair. [02:09:39:23-02:09:42:07] It's one of the oldest families in France. [02:09:42:23-02:09:46:04] It's from a line of the Merovingian kings. [02:09:55:07-02:09:57:02] Royal blood. [02:09:59:03-02:10:00:17] I was so wrong. [02:10:02:09-02:10:06:16] Saunière didn't want you to help guard the secret of the Holy Grail. [02:10:08:10-02:10:09:17] Sophie, [02:10:12:06-02:10:14:02] you are the secret. [02:10:15:18-02:10:17:15] You survived the accident. [02:10:18:11-02:10:21:06] If it even was an accident. [02:10:21:08-02:10:23:06] The Priory found out. [02:10:23:21-02:10:27:01] Somehow they concealed the fact that you were alive. [02:10:27:15-02:10:30:14] They hid you with the Grand Master himself, [02:10:31:12-02:10:33:11] who raised you as his own. [02:10:34:17-02:10:36:13] According to all of this, [02:10:38:00-02:10:39:18] Princess Sophie... [02:10:43:11-02:10:45:02] ...you are the heir. [02:10:47:03-02:10:49:05] The end of the bloodline. [02:10:50:19-02:10:53:20] You are the last living descendent [02:10:55:04-02:10:57:00] of Jesus Christ. [02:11:42:13-02:11:43:22] What is this? [02:11:45:23-02:11:47:05] Sophie? [02:11:50:10-02:11:51:14] Who are you? [02:11:51:16-02:11:54:15] There have been many names. [02:11:54:17-02:11:56:07] The keepers. [02:11:57:09-02:11:59:04] Guardians. [02:11:59:06-02:12:01:20] The Priory of Sion. [02:12:01:21-02:12:06:22] But to you, Sophie, we are friends of the man who raised you, [02:12:07:14-02:12:09:05] Jacques Saunière. [02:12:11:14-02:12:14:08] He would have wanted you to know [02:12:14:09-02:12:16:21] that he loved you very much. [02:12:17:22-02:12:22:01] And that the Priory are here to protect you now [02:12:22:02-02:12:25:06] as they have always protected our family. [02:12:27:20-02:12:29:23] I gave you up once [02:12:30:18-02:12:33:13] knowing I might never see you again. [02:12:37:06-02:12:39:04] I'm your grandmother, Sophie. [02:12:40:07-02:12:43:17] I have prayed for this moment [02:12:43:19-02:12:45:16] for a very long time. [02:12:47:07-02:12:49:10] Welcome home, child. [02:13:02:07-02:13:03:11] Hey. [02:13:13:20-02:13:17:16] She has some things she wants to tell me. [02:13:18:16-02:13:21:01] About my family. [02:13:27:13-02:13:28:18] What will you do? [02:13:29:22-02:13:33:10] The legend will be revealed when the heir reveals himself. [02:13:34:07-02:13:36:19] They just got the pronoun wrong. [02:13:40:04-02:13:41:20] She said when Saunière died [02:13:41:21-02:13:44:17] he took the location of Mary's sarcophagus with him. [02:13:44:19-02:13:49:09] So there's no way to empirically prove that I am related to her. [02:13:52:04-02:13:54:02] What would you do, Robert? [02:13:55:01-02:13:57:07] Okay, maybe there is no proof. [02:13:57:09-02:13:59:13] Maybe the Grail is lost forever. [02:13:59:14-02:14:03:08] But, Sophie, the only thing that matters is what you believe. [02:14:04:18-02:14:07:22] History shows us Jesus was an extraordinary man. [02:14:07:23-02:14:09:23] A human inspiration. That's it. [02:14:10:20-02:14:13:13] That's all the evidence has ever proved. [02:14:15:00-02:14:16:03] But... [02:14:17:02-02:14:18:23] When I was a boy... [02:14:21:08-02:14:25:05] When I was down in that well Teabing told you about, [02:14:28:13-02:14:30:23] I thought I was going to die, Sophie. [02:14:33:02-02:14:35:06] What I did, [02:14:35:08-02:14:36:17] I prayed. [02:14:38:01-02:14:39:15] I prayed [02:14:39:17-02:14:42:16] to Jesus to keep me alive, [02:14:42:18-02:14:44:07] so I could see my parents again, [02:14:44:09-02:14:46:11] so I could go to school again, [02:14:47:12-02:14:49:18] so I could play with my dog. [02:14:51:03-02:14:54:03] Sometimes I wonder if I wasn't alone down there. [02:14:56:08-02:14:59:05] Why does it have to be human or divine? [02:14:59:06-02:15:01:04] Maybe human is divine. [02:15:02:11-02:15:04:04] Why couldn't Jesus have been a father [02:15:04:06-02:15:07:01] and still been capable of all those miracles? [02:15:07:16-02:15:10:12] Like turning water into wine? [02:15:10:14-02:15:13:16] Well, who knows? His blood is your blood. [02:15:14:13-02:15:17:15] Maybe that junkie in the park will never touch a drug again. [02:15:18:05-02:15:21:08] Maybe you healed my phobia with your hands. [02:15:21:10-02:15:24:10] And maybe you're a knight on a Grail quest. [02:15:27:06-02:15:29:19] Well, here's the question. [02:15:30:16-02:15:33:09] A living descendent of Jesus Christ, [02:15:34:22-02:15:37:11] would she destroy faith? [02:15:38:00-02:15:40:22] Or would she renew it? [02:15:43:13-02:15:46:17] So again I say, what matters is what you believe. [02:15:49:01-02:15:50:08] Thank you. [02:15:52:12-02:15:53:18] For bringing me here. [02:15:55:19-02:15:58:07] For letting him choose you, [02:15:59:04-02:16:00:08] Sir Robert. [02:16:10:15-02:16:11:15] You take care. [02:16:13:05-02:16:14:08] Yes. [02:16:38:23-02:16:40:02] Hey. [02:16:53:03-02:16:54:03] Nope. [02:16:55:11-02:16:57:17] Maybe I'll do better with the wine. [02:17:01:04-02:17:02:12] Godspeed. [02:18:01:09-02:18:03:04] Bloodline. [02:18:06:04-02:18:07:13] Rose Line. [02:18:14:08-02:18:16:09] Hides beneath the Rose. [02:19:07:22-02:19:11:12] The Holy Grail 'neath ancient Roslin waits. [02:19:14:16-02:19:18:02] Adorned in masters' loving art, She lies. [02:19:34:06-02:19:37:21] The blade and chalice guarding o'er Her gates. [02:20:17:08-02:20:20:19] She rests at last beneath starry skies.</property>
