[00:10:32:20-00:10:38:21] Tornado, my old friend, you are getting too old for this. [00:10:39:05-00:10:41:11] Yes, me too. [00:11:50:07-00:11:53:06] But the good prince was not afraid of the evil king. [00:11:53:09-00:11:55:23] He raced across the drawbridge, fighting off 100 guards. [00:11:56:07-00:12:00:00] And then, looking very handsome and dashing in the late-afternoon sun... [00:12:00:08-00:12:03:17] ...he leapt onto the balcony and thrust his enchanted sword... [00:12:03:21-00:12:05:06] ...under the king's chin. [00:12:06:06-00:12:10:15] You would kill three innocent men just to capture me? [00:12:10:18-00:12:12:13] Yes. [00:12:13:23-00:12:18:17] Then suddenly lightning flashed and thunder shocked the wasted land. [00:12:18:20-00:12:23:17] The evil king glared at the good prince and said.... [00:12:26:06-00:12:28:12] Something very forgettable. [00:12:28:16-00:12:31:06] And the good prince, what did he do? [00:12:32:10-00:12:37:10] Well, he leapt from the balcony onto his faithful old steed, Tornado... [00:12:37:13-00:12:40:21] ...and raced home to his beautiful wife, Esperanza... [00:12:41:00-00:12:43:16] ...and to his little child, Elena. [00:12:43:19-00:12:47:22] Never to do anything so foolish or dangerous again. [00:12:48:01-00:12:51:06] She loves to hear your stories. [00:12:53:08-00:12:55:11] It's only the sound of my voice. [00:12:55:18-00:12:57:23] One day she will have no time for them. [00:12:58:07-00:13:01:21] I never tire of them. Why should she? [00:13:08:21-00:13:11:09] Esperanza. [00:13:17:18-00:13:20:12] She already has your strength. [00:13:20:15-00:13:24:11] Today she broke the little clay horse you made for her. [00:13:24:14-00:13:26:13] Diego. [00:13:26:16-00:13:28:21] It's just a scratch. [00:13:29:00-00:13:31:10] Diego, you promised me. [00:13:31:13-00:13:35:11] No more nights waiting up praying you come home alive. [00:13:35:14-00:13:40:22] The Spaniards are going home. Today is Zorro's last ride. [00:13:41:01-00:13:45:21] From now on we will grow old together with our five children. [00:13:46:00-00:13:50:09] -Five? -Yeah. Not enough? [00:13:50:22-00:13:53:10] I love you. [00:14:05:02-00:14:09:00] Doña de la Vega, still as beautiful as ever. [00:14:09:21-00:14:15:14] Don Rafael, what an honor. The governor in my home. [00:14:15:17-00:14:21:03] -You'll stay for dinner, of course. -I have come to apologize, Esperanza. [00:14:21:11-00:14:26:02] I'm sorry that I could not protect this country from the peasants. [00:14:26:17-00:14:29:10] I'm sorry that I couldn't make you love me. [00:14:29:14-00:14:32:20] And I'm sorry that I have to leave you without a husband. [00:14:33:12-00:14:34:23] Arrest him. [00:14:52:14-00:14:56:10] Blood never lies, Zorro. [00:14:57:12-00:15:02:22] You are a traitor to your country and your class. Take him away. [00:15:08:21-00:15:10:19] Wait. [00:15:46:22-00:15:50:01] -No! -No! [00:16:09:04-00:16:13:04] I would never have let any harm come to her. [00:16:13:12-00:16:15:15] She was never yours to protect. [00:16:19:03-00:16:20:23] Elena. [00:16:31:15-00:16:34:02] I want you to live with the knowledge... [00:16:34:05-00:16:36:17] ...that you have lost everything that you hold dear. [00:16:38:20-00:16:41:15] I want you to suffer as I have suffered... [00:16:41:18-00:16:43:23] ...knowing that your child should have been mine. [00:17:02:20-00:17:06:17] Elena! Elena! [00:17:22:19-00:17:24:19] Let me hold her. [00:17:25:21-00:17:27:22] Let me hold her! [00:17:28:15-00:17:31:03] Rafael! [00:17:31:06-00:17:34:05] She has her mother's eyes. [00:17:43:16-00:17:48:03] Rafael! You'll never be rid of me! [00:18:24:04-00:18:28:03] Stayed on their track Bringing them back [00:18:28:06-00:18:33:09] So pay the bounty now to me 'Cause.... [00:18:39:08-00:18:42:01] 'Cause...? [00:18:42:04-00:18:44:19] -Nobody's tough as Jack -Nobody's tough as Jack [00:18:44:22-00:18:47:09] -Nobody's tough as Jack -Nobody's tough as Jack [00:18:49:02-00:18:52:04] Now you're getting there. Like I done told you... [00:18:52:07-00:18:55:07] ...singing can lighten your terrible load. [00:19:14:23-00:19:17:19] Hey, hey, hey! [00:19:17:22-00:19:23:02] Come one, come all, for the fright of your life. [00:19:23:05-00:19:29:10] See the notorious Murrieta brothers. Robbers, horse thieves... [00:19:29:18-00:19:35:19] ...bandits, people of the worst sort. Hey! Get out here. [00:19:37:07-00:19:43:00] Garcia. The Murrieta brothers. [00:19:45:18-00:19:48:04] Get over here. [00:20:01:04-00:20:04:10] These men are now in the custody of Corporal Armando Garcia. [00:20:04:18-00:20:06:19] We will take them the rest of the way. [00:20:06:22-00:20:11:11] -Claim your bounty in Tlaxco. -When bulls start wearing bloomers. [00:20:11:19-00:20:14:07] How much are we worth? [00:20:14:11-00:20:19:20] All figured, about 200 pesos. [00:20:21:00-00:20:25:19] Two hundred pesos? That's it? A lousy 200 pesos apiece? [00:20:25:22-00:20:30:01] -We are wasting time. -That's 200 for the both of you. [00:20:30:05-00:20:34:01] What? Are you crazy? Don't take it, Jack. [00:20:36:09-00:20:40:09] Touch my brother again, and I'll kill you. [00:20:40:12-00:20:42:21] Yes, he will. [00:20:44:06-00:20:47:10] Hey, I thought you were tied up. [00:20:48:20-00:20:50:20] That's because you're stupid. [00:20:55:20-00:20:58:09] Drop it. Drop it. [00:21:02:02-00:21:03:13] Hey. [00:21:05:13-00:21:10:19] -They got a strongbox on the wagon. -We know. That's why we came. [00:21:15:06-00:21:19:22] It is a fact that I, the legendary Three-Fingered Jack... [00:21:20:01-00:21:23:03] ...ain't even mentioned. I ain't even mentioned. [00:21:23:06-00:21:28:09] Ain't I the one that figured to kidnap the mayor from his own outhouse? [00:21:28:12-00:21:32:21] I tell you, I am the holy guts of this gang. [00:21:33:00-00:21:36:09] Without me, the whole dang opera falls apart. [00:22:26:01-00:22:27:23] Go. Go. [00:22:28:03-00:22:30:04] Come on. Get up, get up. [00:22:34:08-00:22:36:03] Go. [00:22:37:22-00:22:39:12] Go. [00:23:00:07-00:23:04:08] I want you to know I consider this an honor. [00:23:37:16-00:23:42:04] Bury the body. Bag the head. [00:24:42:00-00:24:45:08] Of course I have feelings for you. [00:24:45:11-00:24:51:12] Yes, yes, but quick. Hide in the barn. [00:24:51:15-00:24:53:11] He's coming. [00:24:58:10-00:25:01:14] What do you want? Please don't touch me. [00:25:01:18-00:25:04:14] What do you want? Who are you? [00:25:11:04-00:25:13:18] Don Rafael! [00:26:07:10-00:26:09:10] Listen to me. [00:26:10:06-00:26:13:06] If any of you is, or ever was... [00:26:13:10-00:26:17:10] ...that masked man all dressed in black known as Zorro... [00:26:18:06-00:26:20:09] ...reveal himself now. [00:26:21:07-00:26:23:19] I'm Zorro! [00:26:24:03-00:26:29:10] -They took my mask, my sword-- -Silence, you old fool! [00:26:29:13-00:26:34:13] I am Zorro! I am the man you want. I am the original-- [00:26:34:16-00:26:39:10] Liar! Anyone can see you are too tall. [00:27:24:18-00:27:29:04] Get him out of here before he starts to stink. [00:27:46:22-00:27:48:18] Did you find him? [00:27:52:10-00:27:54:05] He's dead. [00:27:55:09-00:27:58:12] Back to the boat. I need some sleep before landing tomorrow. [00:29:44:15-00:29:47:08] The governor has returned! [00:29:56:22-00:29:58:00] Luiz. [00:29:59:12-00:30:02:13] Welcome home, Rafael. It has been too long. [00:30:02:16-00:30:04:18] Too long, my friend. [00:30:05:09-00:30:08:17] You said once you favored me above all. [00:30:08:20-00:30:12:22] Consider this a fool's apology for ever doubting you. [00:30:18:19-00:30:23:16] Come. A crowd has gathered to greet you. [00:30:27:16-00:30:30:17] -Don Pedro. -Don Rafael, welcome. [00:30:30:20-00:30:32:14] -You're looking well. -Thank you. [00:30:32:18-00:30:34:10] -Don Hector. -Welcome back, sir. [00:30:34:13-00:30:37:02] Don Julio. [00:30:37:10-00:30:39:19] Gentlemen. [00:30:46:15-00:30:49:12] Please, please. [00:30:50:11-00:30:53:12] I know you are not really happy to see me... [00:30:53:16-00:30:56:23] ...so let us all stop pretending, shall we? [00:30:57:02-00:31:00:02] You think I don't know that you have been paid... [00:31:00:10-00:31:03:22] ...even threatened, to come out in the hot sun and greet me? [00:31:04:18-00:31:08:15] I understand exactly how you feel. [00:31:08:18-00:31:13:14] Why should you care about any of your leaders, past or present? [00:31:13:17-00:31:15:23] What did they ever do for you? [00:31:16:12-00:31:20:03] The Spaniards oppressed you, the Mexicans ignored you. [00:31:20:23-00:31:24:04] And the dons? Well, the dons, the dons. [00:31:24:12-00:31:29:14] The dons seem merely content to cheat and lie to you. [00:31:31:17-00:31:36:12] In fact, I put it to you. Who, in your entire history, has ever helped you? [00:31:36:15-00:31:41:00] Zorro! Zorro fought for the people. [00:31:45:11-00:31:48:19] Yes, Zorro. [00:31:48:22-00:31:53:03] Where is he now, Padre, your masked friend? [00:31:53:11-00:31:57:01] Unless I am mistaken, he hasn't shown himself in 20 years. [00:31:57:04-00:31:59:21] Twenty years! [00:32:00:13-00:32:02:21] People of California... [00:32:03:00-00:32:06:15] ...the time has come to take our destiny into our own hands. [00:32:06:18-00:32:12:12] Not as Spaniards, not as Mexicans, but as Californians. [00:32:19:00-00:32:23:15] I stand here before you today with no mask. [00:32:23:19-00:32:29:18] Only a pledge, a solemn pledge that I will never abandon you. [00:32:29:21-00:32:33:17] And you have my word, the word of Rafael Montero... [00:32:33:20-00:32:37:01] ...that I will do everything within my power to help you fight... [00:32:37:05-00:32:40:02] ...for a free and independent California! [00:32:51:06-00:32:53:02] Father. [00:32:58:12-00:33:02:20] Gentlemen, allow me to introduce my daughter, Elena. [00:33:09:20-00:33:12:12] Thank you. [00:33:13:21-00:33:16:23] Can anyone tell me what this flower is? I know this scent. [00:33:18:06-00:33:19:22] It's called romneya. [00:33:20:20-00:33:21:20] But it only grows in California... [00:33:21:23-00:33:24:20] ...and I believe this is your first visit to our shores. [00:33:24:23-00:33:26:16] Yes. [00:33:54:15-00:33:58:06] Hey, hey, hey. More whiskey. [00:33:59:16-00:34:03:16] Or whatever you call this. I don't want to see the bottom of this glass. [00:34:03:19-00:34:05:02] Money first. [00:34:05:05-00:34:07:03] Money first. [00:34:08:13-00:34:11:04] Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait! [00:34:13:23-00:34:16:22] -What about this? -Silver! [00:34:18:01-00:34:21:01] Of course, silver. The finest. [00:34:27:20-00:34:31:04] -Where did you get that? -It's none of your business. [00:34:32:06-00:34:34:06] Where did you get it? [00:34:37:15-00:34:39:15] It was my brother's. [00:34:40:19-00:34:42:15] He is dead. [00:34:45:04-00:34:48:14] -I'm sorry. -You're sorry? [00:34:48:17-00:34:51:00] Why should you be sorry? [00:34:52:17-00:34:55:17] You should not trade it for a mere glass of whiskey. [00:34:55:21-00:34:59:20] Why not? You think I could get two? [00:35:06:23-00:35:08:17] Who is that? [00:35:13:05-00:35:16:00] -That's the man who killed my brother. -You're drunk and angry... [00:35:16:04-00:35:19:09] ...in no condition to fight a professional soldier. [00:35:19:17-00:35:23:03] Get out of my way, old man. [00:35:52:04-00:35:54:17] Would you care to try again? [00:35:55:22-00:35:57:20] You're welcome. [00:36:00:00-00:36:03:06] -For what? -For saving your life. [00:36:07:18-00:36:12:05] -I would have killed him. -No, not today. He is trained to kill. [00:36:12:08-00:36:14:03] You seem trained to drink. [00:36:14:07-00:36:17:08] Oh yes my friend, you would have fought very bravely and died very quickly. [00:36:17:16-00:36:20:01] Who then would avenge your brother? [00:36:21:18-00:36:23:19] I would have found a way. [00:36:24:09-00:36:27:21] -I have never lost a fight. -Except to a crippled old man just now. [00:36:29:23-00:36:33:01] -What is your name? -Alejandro. [00:36:33:06-00:36:35:01] Alejandro. [00:36:37:08-00:36:39:20] You know, there is a saying, a very old saying [00:36:39:23-00:36:42:06] When the pupil is ready, the master will appear. [00:36:42:09-00:36:45:04] If you want to kill this man I can help you and I can teach you how. [00:36:46:00-00:36:48:06] How to move, how to think, how to take your revenge with honor. [00:36:48:18-00:36:52:11] And live to celebrate it. It will take dedication and time. [00:36:53:19-00:36:55:11] Why are you so eager to help me? [00:36:55:19-00:36:59:19] Because once, a long time ago... [00:37:01:22-00:37:03:19] ...you did the same for me. [00:37:14:11-00:37:16:21] I can't believe it. [00:37:17:12-00:37:23:11] I never thought that, one day, I would be standing in the lair of the fox. [00:37:23:23-00:37:25:09] In the lair of Zorro. [00:37:27:19-00:37:31:12] This place was devoted to the training of Zorro. [00:37:33:03-00:37:37:09] Where were you all these years? I thought you were dead. [00:37:38:08-00:37:43:06] I was dead. And we will leave it at that. [00:37:50:01-00:37:55:11] I remember the last time I saw you. You were fighting a hundred men. [00:37:55:19-00:37:57:09] -A hundred men? -I do not forget. [00:37:57:12-00:38:01:13] You were the greatest swordsman who ever lived. Yes. [00:38:01:21-00:38:05:12] Rafael Montero was the governor of California then. [00:38:05:20-00:38:08:03] Do you remember him? [00:38:09:06-00:38:10:13] What? [00:38:11:09-00:38:15:03] Rafael Montero. Do you remember him? [00:38:15:06-00:38:19:06] Yes. His soldiers killed many. [00:38:19:10-00:38:24:05] And he was the sworn enemy of Zorro. You. [00:38:25:09-00:38:29:03] -Montero has come back. -Good. Then you can kill him. [00:38:29:07-00:38:33:19] No, there are too many complications for me to ignore. [00:38:35:07-00:38:38:04] What complications? [00:38:43:23-00:38:47:21] I can see we are not gonna spend much time talking. [00:38:48:11-00:38:52:04] Montero has some plan, some design for California... [00:38:52:07-00:38:56:04] ...otherwise he would not have retained the services of Captain Love. [00:38:56:07-00:39:00:15] -We must find out what that is. -And then what? [00:39:00:23-00:39:05:14] If you are ready, we will both tempt our fates. [00:39:05:22-00:39:07:15] Let's go, then. [00:39:12:00-00:39:14:08] Do you know how to use that thing? [00:39:14:12-00:39:17:13] Yes. The pointy end goes into the other man. [00:39:22:05-00:39:24:11] This is going to take a lot of work. [00:39:26:12-00:39:30:07] This is called a training circle. The master's wheel. [00:39:30:10-00:39:34:13] This circle will be your world, your whole life. [00:39:34:21-00:39:37:23] Till I tell you otherwise, there is nothing outside of it. [00:39:38:02-00:39:42:08] -Captain Love-- -There is nothing outside of it. [00:39:42:12-00:39:46:15] Captain Love does not exist until I say he exists. [00:39:51:13-00:39:57:14] As your skill with the sword improves you will progress to a smaller circle. [00:39:57:22-00:40:01:09] Each new circle brings you that much closer to your adversary. [00:40:01:12-00:40:03:10] That much closer to retribution. [00:40:05:06-00:40:09:09] -I like that part. -Shall we? [00:40:30:11-00:40:35:06] Slow. Attack slow. Attack. [00:40:35:10-00:40:38:08] Slow. Again. Slow. [00:40:38:11-00:40:43:07] First triangle. Slowly. Good. [00:40:43:11-00:40:46:17] -Good. That is good. -Thank you. [00:40:47:01-00:40:49:07] Attack. [00:40:52:04-00:40:54:10] Good. [00:40:55:11-00:40:58:07] Time for a drink. [00:41:09:05-00:41:11:18] Perfect. Do it again. [00:41:29:04-00:41:32:03] One, five, three! [00:41:32:17-00:41:35:05] Six, four, two! [00:41:35:09-00:41:37:17] And lunge. [00:41:38:01-00:41:39:16] Over-lunge! [00:41:48:11-00:41:53:07] Lesson number one. Never attack in anger. [00:41:57:13-00:42:00:16] Lesson number two [00:42:00:19-00:42:03:02] Come with me. [00:42:05:11-00:42:06:16] What? [00:42:20:13-00:42:26:07] -So, what is lesson number three? -To get to lesson number four. [00:42:46:13-00:42:48:13] Again? [00:43:10:14-00:43:16:03] -Black Andalusian. Magnificent. -It looks like your old horse, Tornado. [00:43:55:08-00:43:57:05] Quiet, quiet. [00:44:08:10-00:44:13:18] Damned horse. What are you doing, huh? What are you doing? [00:44:15:18-00:44:17:08] I'll see you tonight. [00:44:39:13-00:44:42:21] Zorro, you look better than ever. [00:45:09:10-00:45:14:07] Be careful, señorita, there are dangerous men about. [00:45:14:10-00:45:19:08] Well, if you see any, be sure to point them out. [00:46:34:15-00:46:39:07] Listen. I'm going to give you the great honor... [00:46:39:10-00:46:41:22] ...of being my horse. [00:46:58:22-00:47:02:16] We are like one spirit. [00:47:07:20-00:47:10:16] Damn it! Stop! [00:48:07:01-00:48:09:17] Go, go, go! [00:48:40:22-00:48:43:16] Get him! [00:50:42:03-00:50:44:03] Kill him. [00:51:20:01-00:51:24:19] Zorro! The legend has returned! [00:52:03:20-00:52:05:09] Don't yell. [00:52:08:17-00:52:10:20] I need sanctuary, Father. You don't know me-- [00:52:10:23-00:52:13:08] Zorro! Of course I know you. [00:52:13:16-00:52:18:15] Zorro, is it really you? The years have been kinder to you than to me. [00:52:18:18-00:52:24:15] I have no time to talk now. Father, please, hide me. [00:52:24:19-00:52:25:23] Come. [00:52:30:16-00:52:33:03] It's just like the old days. [00:52:41:01-00:52:43:09] Padre, is that you? [00:52:44:06-00:52:47:21] Padre Is everything all right? It sounds like there is a battle going on. [00:52:49:03-00:52:54:06] Don't worry, my dear. You are safe in the house of the Lord. [00:52:54:09-00:52:58:21] Of course, Padre. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. [00:52:59:12-00:53:01:02] It has been three days since my last confession. [00:53:01:19-00:53:04:04] Three days? How many sins could you have committed in three days? [00:53:05:00-00:53:07:07] Come back when you have more time, please. [00:53:07:10-00:53:12:17] -Excuse me? -Listen, señorita.... [00:53:15:07-00:53:18:20] Please, go on. [00:53:19:22-00:53:24:05] -I have broken the Fourth Commandment Padre. -You killed somebody? [00:53:24:22-00:53:29:22] -No, that is not the Fourth Commandment. -Of course not. [00:53:31:00-00:53:36:17] In what way did you break the most sacred of Commandments? [00:53:36:20-00:53:39:19] I dishonored my father. [00:53:40:05-00:53:43:19] That is not so bad. Maybe your father deserved it. [00:53:43:22-00:53:50:06] -What did you say? -I said, tell me more, my child. [00:53:51:01-00:53:55:18] Well, I try to behave properly, the way my father would like me to. [00:53:55:22-00:53:59:23] -But I'm afraid my heart is too wild. -Too wild? [00:54:00:02-00:54:04:23] -Yes. -Could you be more specific? [00:54:05:02-00:54:07:12] I had impure thoughts about a man. [00:54:07:20-00:54:12:05] I did. I think he was a bandit or something. He wore a black mask. [00:54:14:22-00:54:20:05] -He had a deep voice? -Yes. [00:54:21:02-00:54:27:05] -Ruggedly handsome? -His face was half-covered. [00:54:27:08-00:54:30:10] But something in his eyes captured me. [00:54:30:22-00:54:32:02] Captured you. [00:54:32:06-00:54:37:06] I felt warm and feverish. [00:54:37:09-00:54:39:03] Lustful? [00:54:42:02-00:54:44:13] Yes, lustful. [00:54:47:10-00:54:48:23] Forgive me. [00:54:53:21-00:54:55:13] I forgive you. [00:54:59:14-00:55:02:08] Look over there, by the altar. [00:55:04:20-00:55:10:06] Search everything. The chapel, the loft, the rectory, all of it. [00:55:10:09-00:55:13:00] This is a house of God. [00:55:13:07-00:55:16:20] Don't worry, Padre, we'll be gone by the time he gets back. [00:55:19:08-00:55:23:02] Señorita, you have done nothing wrong. [00:55:23:05-00:55:27:22] The only sin would be to deny what your heart truly feels. [00:55:28:22-00:55:30:21] Now, go. [00:55:33:23-00:55:35:20] Elena. [00:55:40:20-00:55:43:21] -What are you doing here? -I was confessing. [00:55:44:00-00:55:46:04] -Confessing? -Yes. [00:55:46:22-00:55:49:11] To whom? The priest is here. [00:55:52:14-00:55:56:14] Stand back, Elena. Please. [00:56:15:04-00:56:20:11] Out of respect for Miss Montero, I'll deal with you later. [00:56:28:12-00:56:31:05] Horse! Come here. [00:56:36:16-00:56:41:08] Blackie! Thunder! Storm! [00:56:41:11-00:56:45:03] Stupido! Get over here now! [00:56:46:10-00:56:52:00] I warn you. I'll get another horse. [00:57:59:14-00:58:02:00] So? [00:58:02:03-00:58:04:01] What do you think? [00:58:08:01-00:58:14:10] Sir, I got the black stallion, I carved a "Z" in the-- [00:58:16:05-00:58:19:02] The people will be speaking the name of Zorro again. [00:58:19:05-00:58:25:15] You think stealing a horse makes you worthy enough to wear that mask? [00:58:27:14-00:58:29:15] Be careful. [00:58:32:15-00:58:37:10] You're a thief, Alejandro. A pitiful clown. [00:58:37:13-00:58:41:08] Zorro was a servant of the people, not a seeker of fame like you. [00:58:43:01-00:58:44:05] A buffoon. [00:58:47:03-00:58:50:11] -Zorro did what was needed. -Now he is needed again. [00:58:53:02-00:58:55:12] I didn't ask for your help in the cantina... [00:58:55:15-00:59:00:03] ...but I came here to learn how to fight like you. [00:59:00:06-00:59:03:16] To have your strength, your courage. [00:59:03:19-00:59:08:03] Now when I try to use them, you slap me down? [00:59:08:06-00:59:13:17] Let me tell you something. I am tired of all your training, your lecturing. [00:59:14:01-00:59:18:15] I am tired of waiting for you to tell me I am ready. [00:59:18:18-00:59:24:09] I have my own scores to settle, a new life to find. [00:59:25:14-00:59:30:10] I thought I could do it here, but I was wrong. [00:59:31:06-00:59:33:19] Alejandro! [00:59:34:03-00:59:36:03] En garde! [00:59:40:02-00:59:42:07] Choose your weapon. [01:00:01:14-01:00:06:14] Montero has invited every don in California to a banquet. [01:00:06:17-01:00:11:11] If you want to be of service, you can join them as a spy. [01:00:12:11-01:00:15:21] I think I do not understand, sir. [01:00:16:05-01:00:19:16] You have passion, Alejandro, and your skill is growing. [01:00:19:20-01:00:24:05] But to enter Montero's world I must give you something which is beyond your reach. [01:00:24:08-01:00:29:13] -Yes? What is that? -Charm. [01:00:30:19-01:00:32:08] And what is that? [01:00:36:11-01:00:39:14] Convince Montero that you are a gentleman of stature... [01:00:39:18-01:00:42:13] ...and he will let you into his circle. [01:00:45:21-01:00:47:16] Me? [01:00:48:18-01:00:50:20] A gentleman? [01:00:53:05-01:00:55:04] This is gonna take a lot of work. [01:00:56:21-01:00:58:21] Yes. [01:01:17:10-01:01:20:09] Look at me. I look like a butterfly. [01:01:20:12-01:01:22:16] This is the most stupid thing I've ever done. [01:01:23:06-01:01:25:12] -I doubt that. -We'll never get away with this. [01:01:25:16-01:01:27:12] Yes, we will. [01:01:27:15-01:01:32:19] A nobleman is a man who says one thing and thinks another. [01:01:32:22-01:01:34:22] What if Montero realizes who you are? [01:01:35:06-01:01:38:06] Montero thinks of himself as a true nobleman. [01:01:38:09-01:01:42:19] He will never look a servant in the eye. Listen to me. [01:01:42:22-01:01:45:06] Listen to me! [01:01:47:14-01:01:49:16] Most important thing of all... [01:01:49:19-01:01:52:16] ...do not let the dons leave the table without you. [01:01:52:19-01:01:54:13] Yes, sir. [01:01:55:19-01:01:59:23] -Good luck tonight. -Thank you. [01:02:00:07-01:02:04:16] Stand up straight. Charm. [01:02:04:19-01:02:06:13] Charm. [01:02:24:10-01:02:27:21] Don Rafael Montero? Good evening. [01:02:28:11-01:02:30:23] I am Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia. [01:02:31:22-01:02:36:00] The formal Spanish greeting. I have not seen that in years. [01:02:36:11-01:02:40:21] -My father was very strict. -Who is your father? [01:02:41:00-01:02:42:21] Don Bartolo del Castillo. [01:02:44:07-01:02:47:08] I have heard of him, but never had the pleasure of meeting him. [01:02:48:14-01:02:53:11] I arrived last week from Spain by way of Paris, Lisbon and San Francisco. [01:02:53:14-01:02:56:16] I am inspecting my family's holdings. [01:03:01:23-01:03:06:15] Queen Isabella of Spain has been very generous to us. [01:03:07:16-01:03:11:00] Very impressive. What brings you here? [01:03:11:19-01:03:15:19] I heard you were back in California and knew I must introduce myself. [01:03:15:22-01:03:18:12] Her Royal Highness speaks very highly of you. [01:03:20:22-01:03:22:22] Really? [01:03:23:01-01:03:28:08] I was under the impression I fell out of favor with the court when California was lost. [01:03:34:19-01:03:37:11] Only in certain circles. [01:03:37:14-01:03:42:00] Her Majesty knows those unfortunate events were clearly no fault of yours. [01:03:43:08-01:03:48:09] She told me this is still a land of opportunity for a man of vision. [01:03:48:13-01:03:54:17] -And you are a man of vision? -I am a man in search of a vision. [01:03:57:13-01:04:01:17] But my timing is unfortunate. I have interrupted a party. [01:04:01:20-01:04:03:19] Perhaps I could call again? [01:04:05:11-01:04:08:08] No, it would honor me for you to join us. [01:04:08:11-01:04:12:08] No, it would honor me to do so, sir. [01:04:12:12-01:04:16:01] Please allow me to introduce my daughter, Elena. [01:04:20:11-01:04:22:02] Charmed. [01:04:25:18-01:04:29:02] I'm afraid I have brought no gift for the hostess... [01:04:29:10-01:04:32:16] ...but wait a moment. [01:04:44:11-01:04:47:14] -Thank you. -A pleasure. [01:04:51:09-01:04:57:02] Bernardo, pick up your feet. Señorita. Caballero. [01:05:22:00-01:05:24:23] Don Alejandro. [01:05:25:02-01:05:28:00] My father and I would like you to join us at our table. [01:05:29:00-01:05:32:01] I would be delighted, señorita. [01:05:44:17-01:05:47:15] Don Alejandro, I'm so pleased you could join us. [01:05:47:19-01:05:51:12] Gentlemen, allow me to introduce Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia. [01:05:51:15-01:05:54:00] Recently returned from Spain. [01:05:54:04-01:06:00:17] This is Captain Harrison Love. Not a don, but a kindred spirit. [01:06:02:04-01:06:06:23] Are you not the man who was chasing a legendary bandit recently? [01:06:07:02-01:06:10:17] -He was hardly legendary. -So you caught him? [01:06:10:20-01:06:16:16] -It's only a matter of time. -The bandit may have escaped... [01:06:16:19-01:06:21:23] ...but the rest of us will think twice before going to confession. [01:06:45:19-01:06:47:06] Thank you. [01:06:50:17-01:06:53:03] With all due respect, Don Hector, I disagree. [01:06:53:21-01:06:56:06] Until these people are free to govern themselves... [01:06:56:14-01:07:00:01] ...I think we will see many more Z's carved into walls. [01:07:01:16-01:07:05:20] Don Alejandro, what do you think? [01:07:05:23-01:07:10:19] I think sheep will always need a shepherd. [01:07:11:00-01:07:16:03] But certainly not this Zorro creature. [01:07:16:06-01:07:22:03] He probably wears the mask to hide his bald head and unsightly features. [01:07:25:03-01:07:29:21] -There are some that would call him heroic. -Heroism, a romantic illusion. [01:07:30:00-01:07:33:07] -Much like nobility. -Elena, that is enough. [01:07:33:15-01:07:37:05] I would think heroism is something to aspire to, not sneer at. [01:07:37:13-01:07:42:04] All that playing swords, shooting guns, racing around on horses... [01:07:42:07-01:07:44:01] ...gives me a frightful headache. [01:07:44:22-01:07:48:02] Such sweaty pursuits are hardly the work of a gentleman. [01:07:48:06-01:07:51:06] And what is? Climbing in and out of carriages? [01:07:51:18-01:07:53:05] No, my dear. [01:07:53:08-01:07:59:01] But increasing one's holdings so as to provide lavish comfort for ladies. [01:07:59:04-01:08:01:15] Such as yourself. [01:08:07:21-01:08:10:17] A woman's grasp of politics. What can I say? [01:08:14:09-01:08:20:05] Well, we're at a party, aren't we? May I have the honor of this dance? [01:08:23:08-01:08:25:00] I would be glad to. [01:09:13:05-01:09:16:01] Yes? Were you looking for something? [01:09:16:17-01:09:19:20] A sense of the miraculous in everyday life. [01:09:21:00-01:09:26:04] Oh, really? Look someplace else. The lady and I were trying to dance. [01:09:26:07-01:09:31:16] You were trying. She was succeeding. [01:09:31:19-01:09:36:04] Forgive me, captain. A shameless joke at your expense. [01:09:36:07-01:09:42:07] I hope it will not be the last. Don Rafael wants you back. Now. [01:10:28:06-01:10:33:08] Should we try something more robust, or do you feel unequal to the task? [01:10:33:11-01:10:36:02] No, on the contrary. [01:10:36:05-01:10:40:22] I think only of your distaste for perspiration. [01:10:41:02-01:10:42:10] Maestro. [01:12:08:23-01:12:12:20] Well, that is the way they are dancing in Madrid these days. [01:12:12:23-01:12:15:23] Excuse me, Don Rafael, I need to catch my breath. [01:12:16:02-01:12:19:04] Your daughter is a very spirited dancer. [01:12:19:07-01:12:24:04] "Spirited." Thank you for putting it so delicately. [01:12:28:11-01:12:30:11] I apologize if you're offended. [01:12:30:15-01:12:34:06] No, no, no. Completely unnecessary, I assure you. [01:12:34:09-01:12:38:15] She is young and impulsive, but her beauty is beyond compare. [01:12:38:23-01:12:42:08] And she has her father's commanding presence. [01:12:44:10-01:12:46:08] Don Rafael. [01:12:50:03-01:12:54:09] As an advisor to Her Royal Highness in matters of finance... [01:12:54:12-01:12:58:22] ...it would be my pleasure to introduce you both at court. [01:13:08:21-01:13:12:15] Join us in the courtyard. There is something I want to share with you. [01:13:12:23-01:13:14:11] What is that? [01:13:14:14-01:13:17:02] A vision. [01:13:26:12-01:13:29:06] Fellow dons of California... [01:13:29:09-01:13:34:06] ...all of us can recall the golden years when we ruled this country. [01:13:34:09-01:13:39:04] We commanded respect and amassed a great deal of wealth. [01:13:39:08-01:13:41:12] But there was something that we never achieved. [01:13:41:16-01:13:45:06] We never determined our own destiny. [01:13:46:13-01:13:53:00] Well, the time has come to claim what always should have been ours. [01:13:53:03-01:13:56:01] My friends... [01:13:56:04-01:14:02:10] ...I give you the independent Republic of California. [01:14:17:00-01:14:20:17] Don Rafael, every man here owes you something. [01:14:21:04-01:14:23:17] The land you gave us made us all wealthy men. [01:14:24:01-01:14:28:12] However, we must question your motives. [01:14:28:15-01:14:31:23] The day you arrived, you made us look like fools. [01:14:32:07-01:14:35:10] That is absurd, Don Pedro. I was merely playing to the crowd. [01:14:35:13-01:14:39:03] And what are you doing now if not playing to the crowd? [01:14:39:06-01:14:43:08] You're inciting us to raise arms against Santa Anna. [01:14:43:11-01:14:46:13] You know perfectly well we could never defeat his army. [01:14:47:13-01:14:50:10] I was not suggesting that we fight him for California. [01:14:50:13-01:14:53:11] I was suggesting that we buy it from him. [01:14:54:02-01:14:57:05] Santa Anna is waging an expensive war with the United States... [01:14:57:22-01:14:59:05] ...and is increasingly short of money. [01:14:59:17-01:15:02:10] Even if we all combined our fortunes... [01:15:02:13-01:15:06:03] ...we could not come up with enough to buy this country from Santa Anna. [01:15:07:00-01:15:09:03] I have already brokered a deal with him. [01:15:10:15-01:15:12:15] You are living in a dream. [01:15:14:11-01:15:18:16] And why don't we all live in the same dream together? [01:15:33:12-01:15:36:06] Meet me here tomorrow morning for a journey... [01:15:36:09-01:15:40:02] ...that will open your eyes and lay all your doubts to rest. [01:16:33:09-01:16:38:05] My friends, I give you El Dorado! [01:16:48:16-01:16:51:20] Technically, of course, all this gold belongs to Santa Anna... [01:16:52:04-01:16:56:07] ...but, fortunately for us, he's completely unaware of its existence. [01:16:56:10-01:16:59:07] For the deception to work, these bars have been marked... [01:17:00:13-01:17:02:09] ...with the Spanish seal so that he'll think they've come from Spain. [01:17:03:19-01:17:06:21] You see now, gentlemen? Is it becoming clearer to you? [01:17:07:05-01:17:11:19] Two days from now we will buy this country from Santa Anna. [01:17:12:03-01:17:15:04] But we will buy it with gold dug from his own land. [01:17:25:19-01:17:31:10] -Where did you find all these people? -Anywhere we wanted. [01:17:32:04-01:17:33:21] Brilliant. [01:17:35:09-01:17:36:18] Brilliant. [01:17:40:06-01:17:42:15] It's only part of the mining process. [01:17:42:18-01:17:46:05] First we picked it up off the ground, now we're down to blasting. [01:18:00:19-01:18:05:12] So this is the future of California? [01:18:06:09-01:18:10:06] This is my vision, yes. [01:18:12:16-01:18:18:05] Up here. Well, now, ain't you a sight for sore eyes! [01:18:19:05-01:18:23:13] Full-grown vultures walking around like real folk. [01:18:23:16-01:18:27:11] Welcome. Welcome to hell's outhouse. [01:18:28:05-01:18:34:05] They call us the disappeared ones, but we ain't exactly disappeared. [01:18:35:00-01:18:39:16] -We're just hard to find. -Wait! You. I know you. [01:18:40:08-01:18:41:15] You bet you do, peckerwood. [01:18:42:15-01:18:44:11] I'm the legendary Three-Fingered Jack. [01:18:45:07-01:18:48:00] And you are a bunch of murdering trash... [01:18:48:17-01:18:52:15] ...dressed up in fancy, sweet-smelling doodads. [01:18:52:18-01:18:55:18] Ignore him, gentlemen. He's a common thief. [01:18:57:16-01:18:58:10] As common as they come. [01:18:59:07-01:19:02:14] But I ain't nothing compared to you gentlemen. [01:19:03:18-01:19:06:15] I steal gold, I steal money. [01:19:07:00-01:19:11:13] But you, you steal people's lives. [01:19:10:15-01:19:13:22] So damn you! And damn the horse that brung you. [01:19:33:00-01:19:35:00] Peckerwood? [01:20:17:04-01:20:21:00] Is there something amusing, captain? [01:20:21:06-01:20:23:18] Strange, I'd say. [01:20:24:04-01:20:28:04] It's the second time I've shot this man while he was flying through the air. [01:20:36:07-01:20:41:14] Don Alejandro! I need to speak with you at the hacienda, alone. [01:20:42:14-01:20:48:00] -Some other time, perhaps. -Today. Alone. [01:21:10:23-01:21:13:17] Good afternoon, Bernardo. [01:21:14:18-01:21:17:04] Good afternoon, señorita. [01:21:17:07-01:21:19:22] Your voice is so calming. [01:21:20:21-01:21:23:13] He's high-spirited. He needs to hear something soothing. [01:21:23:16-01:21:25:23] Yes, I understand. [01:21:28:01-01:21:31:04] How long have you served Don Alejandro? [01:21:31:12-01:21:35:11] Sometimes it seems interminable. Sorry, I speak out of place. [01:21:35:15-01:21:39:16] Do not worry, Bernardo. He will not hear it from me. [01:21:40:23-01:21:44:17] Don Alejandro confuses me. [01:21:44:20-01:21:50:15] Sometimes he seems so arrogant, so superior. [01:21:50:18-01:21:56:05] And yet the way he looks at me and the way he dances with me.... [01:21:56:13-01:21:59:02] As if he were two completely different men. [01:21:59:06-01:22:00:18] Yeah. [01:22:09:03-01:22:11:23] You look so much like your mother. [01:22:13:23-01:22:15:20] How would you know that? [01:22:16:00-01:22:21:07] Well, I don't see much of Don Rafael in you. [01:22:24:01-01:22:27:06] I know my father wishes I acted more like her. [01:22:27:14-01:22:31:04] She was very proper, my mother. Always appropriate [01:22:31:07-01:22:33:00] Is that how he describes her? [01:22:33:03-01:22:38:04] -Yes. But I do not believe him. -She was more like you. [01:22:40:14-01:22:46:07] Perhaps. It would be a way of knowing her. [01:22:48:20-01:22:54:06] My niñera told me that the departed can see you in the moonlight. [01:22:54:14-01:23:00:15] When I was young I sneaked out at night and rode across Andalusia. [01:23:00:18-01:23:04:06] I would wave at the skies so she would know it was me. [01:23:10:02-01:23:14:00] -How did she die? -Giving birth to me. [01:23:16:00-01:23:20:05] My father rarely speaks of her. I think he finds it too painful. [01:23:21:16-01:23:23:04] Yes. [01:23:29:15-01:23:32:16] I know what it is like to lose a loved one. [01:23:33:05-01:23:35:00] You? [01:23:36:01-01:23:39:21] Yeah. A daughter. Long ago. [01:23:42:05-01:23:47:06] When I see you, I remember what it felt like to be a father. [01:23:50:23-01:23:56:20] -Your mother would be proud of you. -Thank you. [01:23:59:09-01:24:03:08] Bernardo, I have to ask you, have we ever met before? [01:24:04:02-01:24:07:01] No, why would you think that? [01:24:08:19-01:24:13:15] I do not know. It's strange, your voice seems so familiar. [01:24:14:21-01:24:19:02] But I haven't been to Spain since before you were born. [01:24:19:05-01:24:21:04] Of course. [01:24:22:20-01:24:25:21] Well, it's a very pleasant voice. [01:24:27:07-01:24:29:21] Thank you. [01:24:30:00-01:24:33:04] -Good day, Bernardo. -Good day... [01:24:38:21-01:24:40:17] ...Elena. [01:24:55:22-01:24:59:07] Did you know that the Compa Indians of central Peru... [01:24:59:10-01:25:04:04] ...used to cannibalize their enemies in order to absorb their power? [01:25:04:08-01:25:08:04] The eyes in particular were most sought after. [01:25:10:21-01:25:17:00] To be able to see through the eyes of an enemy is a valuable thing. [01:25:21:11-01:25:25:22] Where are my manners? Would you care for something to drink? [01:25:32:11-01:25:34:03] No? [01:25:34:19-01:25:38:08] A different vintage perhaps? [01:25:46:20-01:25:50:00] You're a very sick person, Captain Love. [01:25:51:02-01:25:54:18] Heads in water jars, hands in wine pitchers... [01:25:54:21-01:25:57:21] ...must strike you as odd, I suppose. [01:25:58:21-01:26:02:20] Well, for one thing, I think you ought to fire your housekeeper. [01:26:09:05-01:26:13:03] -Who is he? -An enemy. [01:26:14:22-01:26:17:20] He has a brother out there who will share the same fate. [01:26:21:06-01:26:23:08] I wish you luck. [01:26:28:02-01:26:31:21] -To your health. -Murrieta's brother or not... [01:26:32:00-01:26:35:06] ...you are more than you pretend to be. [01:26:35:09-01:26:40:02] Maybe someday I will see what I look like through your eyes... [01:26:40:05-01:26:42:03] ...Captain Love. [01:27:28:10-01:27:31:04] Oh, it is beautiful. [01:27:46:10-01:27:50:01] Excuse me. How much does it cost? [01:27:55:15-01:27:59:05] It is a gift, she says, in honor of your mother. [01:28:00:14-01:28:02:14] My mother? [01:28:03:21-01:28:08:04] -She loved your mother. -She must be mistaken. [01:28:08:07-01:28:11:14] My mother died long ago in Spain. [01:28:22:23-01:28:24:12] She says there is no mistaking... [01:28:24:15-01:28:28:01] ...the daughter of Esperanza and Diego de la Vega. [01:28:28:04-01:28:34:13] She says she was your nanny. She hung flowers on your crib. [01:28:37:02-01:28:39:12] I'm sorry, I cannot accept it. [01:28:58:22-01:29:01:16] Alejandro. [01:29:02:02-01:29:07:08] Listen to me. Can you find your way back to the mine? [01:29:08:16-01:29:10:13] No. [01:29:11:16-01:29:15:22] The carriage windows were all covered. [01:29:16:02-01:29:20:01] -He didn't even trust his own dons. -Nor would I. [01:29:20:03-01:29:22:06] You must go to Montero's house tonight. [01:29:22:09-01:29:24:11] Break into the chest in his study. [01:29:24:15-01:29:29:04] -Find out what his plans are. -People in the mine are dying. [01:29:29:16-01:29:35:04] And all I can think of is Captain Love. [01:29:35:07-01:29:38:01] He will come into your circle soon enough. [01:29:42:01-01:29:45:03] -I miss my brother, sir. -Your brother is dead. [01:29:45:06-01:29:47:23] We lose the ones we love. We cannot change it. Put it aside. [01:29:49:03-01:29:51:07] How? [01:29:52:14-01:29:55:04] How can I do what is needed... [01:29:55:07-01:30:00:00] ...when all I feel is hate? [01:30:01:11-01:30:03:04] You hide it. [01:30:05:04-01:30:07:04] With this. [01:30:18:05-01:30:21:10] Santa Anna has agreed to the transfer at noon the day after tomorrow. [01:30:21:14-01:30:25:00] He insists we deliver the gold five miles north of town. [01:30:25:03-01:30:26:19] Captain Love? [01:30:30:08-01:30:33:11] It's a safe distance from the mine. The bars are stamped and ready. [01:30:33:14-01:30:35:11] I don't foresee a problem. [01:30:35:15-01:30:41:03] Tell him we agree. You have done well, Luiz. Very well. [01:30:44:13-01:30:48:02] To the independent Republic of California. [01:30:51:13-01:30:54:08] Don Rafael! [01:31:18:15-01:31:21:08] You sent men to the hills? Doubled the guard at the wall? [01:31:21:11-01:31:23:09] Yes, yes, of course. [01:31:29:18-01:31:34:18] -After all, it's only one man. -It isn't just one man. It's Zorro. [01:31:36:03-01:31:40:19] And he knows about the mine. Otherwise he wouldn't be here tonight. [01:31:41:03-01:31:44:08] -How could he possibly--? -It doesn't matter how. [01:31:44:11-01:31:46:13] You don't seem to grasp the situation. [01:31:46:16-01:31:51:09] If Santa Anna finds out about this he will have us butchered. [01:31:52:07-01:31:54:09] Do you understand? [01:31:56:17-01:31:59:07] Then we should destroy the evidence. [01:31:59:10-01:32:01:08] Set explosives. Bury the mine. [01:32:03:13-01:32:07:07] -And the workers? -We destroy all the evidence. [01:32:07:10-01:32:09:10] No witnesses. [01:32:16:08-01:32:19:03] Make sure those papers are locked up. [01:32:36:11-01:32:38:10] Guards! [01:32:47:05-01:32:52:18] -The much-debated Zorro. -No. The legendary Zorro. [01:32:55:15-01:32:59:13] Put down your weapons! Tell them. [01:32:59:17-01:33:01:22] Do as he says. [01:33:07:22-01:33:09:14] Allow me. [01:33:16:06-01:33:18:17] Come. Stop. [01:33:20:11-01:33:22:09] Face the window. [01:33:23:12-01:33:27:15] Now, bend down and touch your toes. [01:33:29:09-01:33:31:17] Bend over! [01:33:33:12-01:33:38:13] Excuse me, Captain Love. Thank you. [01:36:01:18-01:36:03:16] Kill him! [01:36:31:23-01:36:33:23] Good morning, señor. [01:36:38:15-01:36:40:20] -Good morning, señorita. -Give it back. [01:36:41:18-01:36:43:23] -What? -Whatever it is you have stolen... [01:36:44:12-01:36:48:14] ...from my father, I want it back. Give it to me. [01:36:48:22-01:36:51:03] No. [01:36:57:11-01:36:59:10] Come on, now. [01:37:13:07-01:37:16:08] I don't have the time to give you the proper instruction. [01:37:18:15-01:37:22:16] I have had the proper instruction since I was 4. [01:38:16:01-01:38:18:07] Not bad. [01:38:20:06-01:38:22:05] Not bad at all. [01:38:44:16-01:38:49:05] This will make it more difficult. Señorita.... [01:39:14:10-01:39:15:18] Don't move. [01:39:37:06-01:39:40:18] -Do you surrender? -Never. [01:39:41:13-01:39:44:02] But I may scream. [01:39:44:19-01:39:47:03] I understand. [01:39:47:06-01:39:49:19] Sometimes I have that effect. [01:40:18:13-01:40:21:12] Excuse me. [01:40:23:12-01:40:26:04] Goodbye, señorita. [01:40:37:12-01:40:39:04] What are you doing here? What happened? [01:40:39:10-01:40:44:17] Zorro. Zorro was here. I fought him and he left. He left. [01:40:44:21-01:40:51:09] -Did you recognize him? -No, but he was young and vigorous. [01:40:51:16-01:40:55:15] -He was very vigorous, Father. -Vigorous? [01:40:56:08-01:40:58:08] Yes. [01:41:37:11-01:41:38:21] Let's go! [01:42:55:16-01:42:57:11] Go! [01:43:35:07-01:43:36:20] Come on! [01:44:11:09-01:44:16:10] Here. This is the canyon. That is where the mine is. [01:44:17:00-01:44:21:19] They have 25, 30 guards at most. [01:44:21:22-01:44:25:02] -Nothing that Zorro can't overcome. -I'm not going with you. [01:44:25:10-01:44:27:02] What? [01:44:27:17-01:44:30:15] I'm not going with you. [01:44:31:13-01:44:35:20] There's something I must do. It's a personal matter. [01:44:36:17-01:44:40:20] -What about the prisoners? -There's nothing more I can do. [01:44:41:20-01:44:45:19] -You mean, nothing you will do. -I gave my life to them. [01:44:46:15-01:44:50:01] In return, I lose everything. My wife was murdered before my eyes... [01:44:50:09-01:44:53:22] ...and my child was stolen to be raised by my mortal enemy. [01:44:55:09-01:44:57:17] Montero? [01:45:00:03-01:45:01:21] Elena. [01:45:03:17-01:45:05:22] She's your daughter. [01:45:06:22-01:45:09:10] Yeah, she was. [01:45:13:06-01:45:15:00] So... [01:45:16:02-01:45:17:22] ...you will simply take your revenge. [01:45:18:01-01:45:22:18] No, I will take my daughter. And don't pretend she means nothing to you. [01:45:22:21-01:45:27:21] She does. But you taught me to see beyond personal feelings. [01:45:28:00-01:45:32:19] -Was that all a lie? -You're too young to understand. [01:45:32:23-01:45:37:00] To understand what? Betrayal? [01:45:37:04-01:45:41:04] All the work, all the training, all the wise words, for what? [01:45:41:12-01:45:46:18] To smile in the face of my brother's killer while you make your own plans? [01:45:49:05-01:45:53:02] Alejandro, I taught you everything you need to survive. [01:45:53:08-01:45:56:01] Now I must look to my own heart. [01:45:57:17-01:46:02:12] Elena is all I have left. I am not going to lose her again. [01:46:04:19-01:46:09:11] What about California? What about the people? [01:46:09:12-01:46:12:01] They still have Zorro. [01:46:40:12-01:46:45:03] I have every inch of the countryside covered. If he shows himself.... [01:46:46:23-01:46:49:12] -Are you all right? -Do you have the map? [01:46:49:16-01:46:53:04] -We'll find it. -Is your army ready to fight? [01:46:53:12-01:46:56:18] -No, sir. -Then of course I'm not all right. [01:46:56:21-01:47:00:06] I'm beginning to wonder if you want this operation to succeed at all. [01:47:00:14-01:47:02:23] -What are you saying? -What I'm saying, captain... [01:47:03:02-01:47:07:18] ...is that I think my horse could run this army better than you. [01:47:11:18-01:47:14:02] I said I'll find him. [01:47:16:00-01:47:17:14] That means I will. [01:47:20:21-01:47:24:22] Perhaps I can save you the trouble. Go on, reach for it, captain. [01:47:27:17-01:47:31:17] -Who are you? -I warned you long ago, Rafael. [01:47:33:13-01:47:36:21] -You would never be rid of me. -De la Vega. [01:47:41:03-01:47:42:15] Rafael. [01:47:42:20-01:47:45:20] You were not the Zorro I saw last night. [01:47:45:23-01:47:50:03] -That was your master, Don Alejandro. -Yes. [01:47:50:06-01:47:53:07] But there are many who would proudly wear the mask of Zorro. [01:47:53:15-01:47:58:04] Either way, events have been set in motion that you cannot stop. [01:47:59:04-01:48:01:15] I'm not here to stop you. [01:48:03:01-01:48:04:15] Call for Elena. [01:48:08:23-01:48:11:01] Call her. [01:48:12:23-01:48:16:17] Captain, bring my daughter to me. [01:48:18:20-01:48:21:00] Bring her to me! [01:48:29:15-01:48:34:07] You cannot imagine, Rafael, how I have dreamed of this moment. [01:48:34:15-01:48:38:16] Night and day, 20 long years. [01:48:38:19-01:48:43:04] Really? I haven't given you a second thought. [01:48:44:08-01:48:50:19] -If I die, the truth dies with me. -We shall see. [01:48:50:22-01:48:53:03] Father! [01:48:53:06-01:48:57:04] -Bernardo, what are you doing? -Tell her, Rafael. [01:48:58:22-01:49:03:07] -Tell me what? What is going on? -Tell her who her real father is. [01:49:04:18-01:49:07:01] Father, what is he saying? [01:49:09:09-01:49:13:22] This unfortunate man lost a daughter once... [01:49:14:02-01:49:17:05] ...and now he seeks to claim you for his own. [01:49:20:01-01:49:23:05] Tell her how her mother died. [01:49:27:02-01:49:32:09] Your daughter is lost, de la Vega. You cannot have mine. [01:49:33:01-01:49:35:04] De la Vega? [01:49:36:16-01:49:39:20] A woman in town, she told me.... [01:49:41:01-01:49:43:06] Diego de la Vega? [01:49:46:09-01:49:49:04] Father? [01:49:49:07-01:49:52:00] His name is of no consequence. [01:49:55:08-01:49:58:19] I was told my niñera used to hang something on my crib. [01:50:00:09-01:50:04:06] Yes, she had her hang fresh flowers. [01:50:04:09-01:50:06:00] No! [01:50:07:04-01:50:08:22] No! [01:50:14:01-01:50:18:04] Let us finish it, Rafael. Let us finish what we started... [01:50:18:10-01:50:21:02] ...the night Esperanza died. [01:50:21:23-01:50:26:01] Drop your sword or I will have no choice but to have you shot. [01:50:26:20-01:50:29:17] Even in the presence of my daughter. [01:50:32:11-01:50:34:22] Please. [01:50:49:10-01:50:53:12] They were flowers. Romneya. [01:50:59:12-01:51:02:03] Rafael... [01:51:03:19-01:51:05:19] ...she knows. [01:53:14:02-01:53:16:15] Water! [01:53:51:00-01:53:53:11] Lock them up! [01:54:48:09-01:54:51:12] The fuses are burning. Hurry it up. [01:54:55:09-01:54:57:03] Let's go! [01:55:19:13-01:55:21:01] Wait here! [01:55:30:15-01:55:34:03] Secure the wagon, stay alert. [01:57:02:15-01:57:06:04] -De la Vega. -Rafael. [01:58:20:09-01:58:22:22] Only one question. [01:58:25:20-01:58:28:09] Really? What is that? [01:58:32:19-01:58:35:19] How would you like your remains displayed? [02:00:05:15-02:00:10:12] -Now I'm free to kill you. -No! [02:00:16:07-02:00:20:01] Drop the sword. Drop it. [02:00:29:09-02:00:31:23] You really think I would have killed my own child? [02:00:57:08-02:00:59:15] Did you miss me? [02:01:22:13-02:01:25:10] Elena! Get them out! [02:01:31:22-02:01:38:15] -"M" for Murrieta. -Two men. One dead. [02:02:40:18-02:02:45:11] You're doing well. Your brother would have shot himself by now. [02:04:40:12-02:04:42:17] Alejandro. [02:05:58:04-02:06:00:17] Is it finished? [02:06:01:02-02:06:05:17] Yes, Don Diego. It's finished. [02:06:07:03-02:06:09:15] Not for Zorro. [02:06:09:19-02:06:13:16] There will be other days, other battles to fight. [02:06:13:19-02:06:17:09] It is your curse and destiny. [02:06:19:07-02:06:21:16] My beautiful Elena. [02:06:24:07-02:06:27:05] The world is a strange place. [02:06:29:01-02:06:32:00] To have found you at last only to lose you again. [02:06:32:06-02:06:35:01] You will never lose me... [02:06:35:20-02:06:38:01] ...Father. [02:06:41:03-02:06:42:22] Elena. [02:06:45:07-02:06:47:18] You are like your mother. [02:06:49:00-02:06:51:07] Same eyes. [02:06:51:10-02:06:53:22] Same mouth. [02:06:54:01-02:06:56:09] Same spirit. [02:07:01:00-02:07:03:11] Alejandro... [02:07:05:09-02:07:07:10] ...Elena. [02:07:27:09-02:07:32:06] And so it was. Lightning split the sky. [02:07:32:09-02:07:34:21] Thunder shook the air. [02:07:35:00-02:07:38:08] And then all was quiet. [02:07:39:10-02:07:45:07] The great warrior known as Zorro was gone. [02:07:46:10-02:07:48:19] The people of the land gave him a hero's funeral. [02:07:48:23-02:07:51:08] The largest anyone had ever seen. [02:07:52:05-02:07:55:07] They came from far and wide to say farewell... [02:07:55:10-02:07:57:23] ...to the brave and noble champion. [02:08:01:08-02:08:04:00] But don't worry, little Joaquin. [02:08:04:09-02:08:07:06] Whenever great deeds are remembered... [02:08:07:09-02:08:10:08] ...your grandfather will live on. [02:08:11:06-02:08:15:01] For there must always be a Zorro. [02:08:15:04-02:08:20:11] And someday, when he is needed, we will see him again. [02:08:20:19-02:08:25:13] On his fearsome steed, Tornado, riding like the wind. [02:08:25:21-02:08:28:00] His sword blazing in the sun. [02:08:29:02-02:08:32:08] Leaping, jumping! Swinging through the air! [02:08:32:11-02:08:34:23] Fighting like a lion, fighting like a tiger! [02:08:35:02-02:08:37:03] Fighting... [02:08:44:00-02:08:45:20] ...as safely as possible. [02:08:47:14-02:08:50:07] Is this your idea of putting the baby to sleep? [02:08:57:23-02:09:00:07] Sleep tight, my son. [02:09:06:20-02:09:12:10] When I sleep, I will dream of this dashing rogue, Zorro. [02:09:13:01-02:09:16:01] But what face shall I give him? [02:09:16:20-02:09:20:02] He has been many different men... [02:09:20:05-02:09:23:15] ...but he has loved you as all of them. [02:09:27:22-02:09:30:22] How can I refuse such a man? [02:09:31:23-02:09:35:00] Do you know where I might find him? [02:09:35:04-02:09:40:01] You know Zorro. He could be anywhere. [02:09:56:10-02:09:59:03] There, there, my darling.</property>
