[00:04:13:17-00:04:18:07] -Nervous? -Yes. I don't like this. [00:04:18:11-00:04:23:18] You only have 75 more to go, okay? What's this one? [00:04:27:06-00:04:29:06] It's a couple of wavy lines. [00:04:29:10-00:04:33:04] -Sorry. This isn't your lucky day. -I know. [00:04:35:22-00:04:37:18] Wait-- [00:04:41:13-00:04:43:06] I'm getting a little tired of this! [00:04:43:10-00:04:45:20] You volunteered, didn't you? We're paying, aren't we? [00:04:46:00-00:04:49:07] Yeah, but I didn't know you were gonna give me electric shocks! [00:04:49:11-00:04:51:12] What are you trying to prove here, anyway? [00:04:51:16-00:04:55:15] I'm studying the effect of negative reinforcement on ESP ability. [00:04:55:19-00:04:59:06] The effect? I'll tell you what the effect is. It's pissing me off! [00:04:59:10-00:05:01:08] Well, then maybe my theory is correct! [00:05:01:12-00:05:05:07] -You can keep the 5 bucks. I've had it. -I will, mister! [00:05:09:06-00:05:11:23] You may as well get used to that. [00:05:12:05-00:05:16:21] It's the kind of resentment that your ability will provoke in some people. [00:05:17:05-00:05:20:07] Do you think I have it, Dr. Venkman? [00:05:21:15-00:05:24:02] You're no fluke, Jennifer. [00:05:24:06-00:05:26:22] This is it. This is definitely it! [00:05:27:02-00:05:29:06] Did those UV lenses come in for the video camera? [00:05:29:10-00:05:32:23] And that blank tape, I need it, the one you erased yesterday. [00:05:33:03-00:05:36:06] -Will you excuse me for a second? -Sure. [00:05:37:14-00:05:40:22] I'm right in the middle of something, Ray. [00:05:41:02-00:05:42:18] I need a little more time with this subject. [00:05:42:22-00:05:45:10] Could you come back in an hour, hour and a half? [00:05:45:14-00:05:47:14] Peter, at 140 p.m... [00:05:47:18-00:05:51:04] ...at the main branch of The New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue... [00:05:51:08-00:05:56:03] ...10 people witnessed a free-floating, full-torso, vaporous apparition. [00:05:56:07-00:05:58:09] It blew books off shelves from 20 feet away... [00:05:58:13-00:06:00:22] ...and scared the socks off some poor librarian. [00:06:01:03-00:06:03:09] I'm very excited. I'm very pleased. [00:06:03:13-00:06:07:14] I want you to get right down there, check it out, and get back to me. [00:06:07:18-00:06:10:10] You're coming with us on this one. Spengler went down there. [00:06:10:14-00:06:13:15] He took PKE valences, went right off the top of the scale. [00:06:13:19-00:06:18:03] Buried the needle. We're close on this one. I can feel it. [00:06:20:22-00:06:24:18] I can feel it. We're very, very close. [00:06:26:18-00:06:29:20] I have to go now, Jennifer, but I'd like to work with you some more. [00:06:30:00-00:06:32:06] Perhaps you could come back this evening, say at--? [00:06:32:10-00:06:33:20] Eight o'clock? [00:06:34:00-00:06:38:21] I was just going to say, 800? You are a legitimate phenomenon. [00:06:41:22-00:06:43:04] As a friend, I must say... [00:06:43:08-00:06:46:02] ...you've finally gone around the bend on this ghost business. [00:06:46:06-00:06:49:14] You guys have been meeting every schizo in the five boroughs... [00:06:50:10-00:06:52:17] ...who says he has a paranormal experience. What have you seen? [00:06:53:06-00:06:58:05] You forget, I was there at an undersea, unexplained mass sponge migration. [00:06:58:09-00:07:03:07] Oh, Ray, the sponges migrated about a foot and a half. [00:07:09:06-00:07:11:06] -You're here. -Yeah, what have you got? [00:07:11:10-00:07:14:16] This is big Peter, this is very big. There's definitely something here. [00:07:14:20-00:07:18:12] Egon, this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole through your head. [00:07:18:16-00:07:20:18] -Remember that? -That would've worked if-- [00:07:20:22-00:07:23:19] I'm Roger Delacorte. Are you the men from the university? [00:07:23:23-00:07:27:14] Yes. I'm Dr. Venkman. Dr. Stantz. Egon. [00:07:27:18-00:07:31:17] Thank you for coming. I hope we can clear this up quickly and quietly. [00:07:31:21-00:07:36:06] Let's not rush things. We don't even know what you have yet. [00:07:36:22-00:07:38:18] I don't remember seeing any legs... [00:07:38:22-00:07:42:01] ...but it definitely had arms, because it reached out for me. [00:07:42:05-00:07:44:08] Arms? I can't wait to get a look at this thing. [00:07:44:12-00:07:47:07] Alice, I'll ask you a couple of standard questions, okay? [00:07:47:19-00:07:49:19] Have you or any member of your family... [00:07:49:23-00:07:54:02] ...ever been diagnosed schizophrenic, mentally incompetent? [00:07:54:21-00:07:57:23] My uncle thought he was St. Jerome. [00:07:59:03-00:08:02:00] I'd call that a big yes. [00:08:03:01-00:08:06:11] Are you habitually using drugs, stimulants, alcohol? [00:08:06:15-00:08:09:22] -No. -No, no. Just asking. [00:08:10:06-00:08:13:14] Are you, Alice, menstruating right now? [00:08:13:18-00:08:18:22] -What has that got to do with it? -Back off, man. I'm a scientist. [00:08:19:04-00:08:22:05] Ray, it's moving. Come on. [00:08:47:06-00:08:48:16] Look! [00:08:54:07-00:08:58:02] -This is hot, Ray. -Symmetrical book-stacking. [00:08:58:06-00:09:02:06] Just like the Philadelphia mass turbulence of 1947. [00:09:02:14-00:09:06:16] You're right. No human being would stack books like this. [00:09:07:04-00:09:10:18] Listen! Do you smell something? [00:09:18:14-00:09:22:08] Talk about telekinetic activity. Look at this mess. [00:09:23:06-00:09:25:14] Raymond, look at this. [00:09:26:02-00:09:28:06] Ectoplasmic residue. [00:09:28:10-00:09:32:14] -Venkman, get a sample of this. -It's the real thing. [00:09:32:18-00:09:34:22] Somebody blows their nose, and you wanna keep it? [00:09:35:02-00:09:36:20] I'd like to analyze it. [00:09:37:00-00:09:40:23] -There's more over here. -I'm getting stronger readings here. [00:09:47:01-00:09:48:19] This way. [00:09:50:17-00:09:52:07] Come on. [00:10:02:04-00:10:04:12] Egon, your mucus. [00:10:11:19-00:10:13:21] This happen to you before? [00:10:15:18-00:10:17:09] First time? [00:10:42:17-00:10:44:10] It's here. [00:10:45:08-00:10:49:14] A full torso apparition. And it's real. [00:10:54:07-00:10:56:06] So, what do we do? [00:11:01:02-00:11:04:06] Could you come over here and talk to me for a second, please? [00:11:04:10-00:11:06:13] Could you just come here for a second, please? [00:11:06:17-00:11:10:04] Right over here. Come here, Francine. Come here. [00:11:10:18-00:11:13:20] -What do we do? -I don't know. What do you think? [00:11:14:00-00:11:15:19] Stop that! [00:11:16:02-00:11:19:06] We've gotta make contact. One of us should try to speak to it. [00:11:19:10-00:11:20:21] Good idea. [00:11:29:14-00:11:31:02] Hello. [00:11:31:15-00:11:33:07] I'm Peter. [00:11:34:03-00:11:37:10] Where are you from? Originally. [00:11:42:02-00:11:45:07] All right. Okay. The usual stuff isn't working. [00:11:45:11-00:11:49:19] Okay, I have a plan. I know exactly what to do. [00:11:51:18-00:11:53:21] Now, stay close. [00:11:54:05-00:11:56:06] Stay close. [00:11:56:12-00:11:59:10] I know. Do exactly as I say. [00:11:59:14-00:12:01:21] Get ready. Ready? [00:12:02:01-00:12:03:13] Get her! [00:12:12:01-00:12:15:02] -Did you see it? What was it? -We'll get back to you. [00:12:15:06-00:12:16:16] Wait! [00:12:25:13-00:12:30:00] Get her. That was your whole plan. Get her. [00:12:31:01-00:12:35:00] -It was scientific. -I just got overexcited. [00:12:35:04-00:12:39:02] But wasn't it incredible, Pete? We actually touched the etheric plane. [00:12:39:06-00:12:41:05] You know what this could mean to the school? [00:12:41:09-00:12:43:21] Yeah, it's gonna be bigger than the microchip. [00:12:44:01-00:12:45:18] The experience wasn't completely wasted. [00:12:45:22-00:12:48:14] According to these readings, we have an excellent chance... [00:12:48:18-00:12:50:14] ...of catching and holding a ghost. [00:12:50:18-00:12:54:22] This is great. If the ionization rate is constant for all ectoplasmic entities... [00:12:55:02-00:12:58:03] ...we could really bust some heads. In a spiritual sense, of course. [00:12:58:07-00:13:01:08] Spengs, you serious about this catching a ghost? [00:13:01:12-00:13:03:10] I'm always serious. [00:13:03:23-00:13:07:15] Egon, I'm gonna take back some of the things I've said about you. [00:13:10:14-00:13:12:06] You've earned it. [00:13:14:08-00:13:18:11] The possibilities are limitless. Hey, Dean Yeager. [00:13:22:00-00:13:24:14] I trust you're moving us to better quarters on campus. [00:13:24:18-00:13:26:21] No, you're being moved off campus. [00:13:27:01-00:13:29:18] The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant. [00:13:29:22-00:13:32:17] You are to vacate these premises immediately. [00:13:32:21-00:13:35:20] This is preposterous. I demand an explanation. [00:13:36:00-00:13:39:01] Fine. This university will no longer continue... [00:13:39:05-00:13:42:12] ...any funding of any kind for your group's activities. [00:13:42:16-00:13:44:08] But the kids love us. [00:13:44:12-00:13:50:15] Dr. Venkman, we believe the purpose of science is to serve mankind. [00:13:50:19-00:13:55:09] You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of dodge or hustle. [00:13:55:13-00:13:57:22] Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe. [00:13:58:02-00:14:01:06] Your methods are sloppy, and your conclusions are highly questionable. [00:14:01:10-00:14:05:02] You are a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman. [00:14:06:05-00:14:07:19] I see. [00:14:07:23-00:14:12:19] And you have no place in this department or in this university. [00:14:13:06-00:14:16:07] This is a major disgrace. Forget MIT or Stanford now. [00:14:16:11-00:14:18:18] They wouldn't touch us with a 10-meter cattle prod. [00:14:18:22-00:14:21:02] You're always so concerned about your reputation. [00:14:21:06-00:14:24:04] Einstein did his best stuff when he was working as a patent clerk. [00:14:24:08-00:14:26:06] You know how much a patent clerk earns? [00:14:26:10-00:14:30:07] The university gave us money. We didn't have to produce anything. [00:14:30:11-00:14:33:08] You've never been out of college. You don't know what it's like. [00:14:33:12-00:14:36:22] I've worked in the private sector. They expect results. [00:14:37:02-00:14:38:23] For whatever reasons, Ray... [00:14:39:03-00:14:44:04] ...call it fate, call it luck, call it karma... [00:14:44:08-00:14:47:04] ...I believe that everything happens for a reason. [00:14:47:08-00:14:51:10] I believe that we were destined to get thrown out of this dump. [00:14:51:14-00:14:56:14] -For what purpose? -To go into business for ourselves. [00:15:00:13-00:15:03:05] This ecto-containment system Spengler and I have in mind... [00:15:03:09-00:15:07:03] ...will require a load of bread to capitalize. Where will we get the money? [00:15:08:21-00:15:12:12] I don't know. I don't know. [00:15:14:13-00:15:16:18] You're never gonna regret this, Ray. [00:15:16:22-00:15:19:11] My parents left me that house. I was born there. [00:15:19:15-00:15:23:01] You're not gonna lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages nowadays. [00:15:23:05-00:15:25:18] But at 19 percent? You didn't even bargain with the guy. [00:15:25:22-00:15:28:06] Ray, for your information, the interest rate alone... [00:15:28:10-00:15:31:08] ...for the first five years comes to 95,000 dollars. [00:15:31:12-00:15:34:12] Will you guys relax? We are on the threshold of establishing... [00:15:34:16-00:15:37:18] ...the indispensable defense science of the next decade [00:15:37:22-00:15:41:12] Professional paranormal investigations and eliminations. [00:15:41:16-00:15:46:07] The franchise rights alone will make us rich beyond our wildest dreams. [00:15:46:11-00:15:49:15] There's office space, sleeping quarters and showers... [00:15:49:19-00:15:51:10] ...and there's a full kitchen. [00:15:51:14-00:15:56:13] It just seems a little pricey for a unique fixer-upper opportunity, that's all. [00:15:56:17-00:15:58:12] What do you think, Egon? [00:15:58:16-00:16:00:22] I think this building should be condemned. [00:16:01:03-00:16:03:16] There's metal fatigue in all the load-bearing members. [00:16:03:20-00:16:07:11] The wiring is substandard. It's inadequate for our power needs. [00:16:07:15-00:16:10:13] And the neighborhood is like a demilitarized zone. [00:16:10:17-00:16:13:15] Hey, does this pole still work? [00:16:16:10-00:16:20:18] Wow, this place is great. When can we move in? [00:16:20:22-00:16:24:21] You gotta try this pole. I'm gonna get my stuff. [00:16:28:06-00:16:33:06] Hey, we should stay here tonight, sleep here. You know, to try it out. [00:16:43:00-00:16:45:05] -I think we'll take it. -Good. [00:17:20:03-00:17:21:09] Hi. [00:17:26:22-00:17:29:09] -Dana, it's you. -Hi. Yes, Louis, it's me. [00:17:29:13-00:17:31:22] -I thought it was the drugstore. -Are you sick? [00:17:32:02-00:17:33:19] No, I'm fine. I feel great. [00:17:33:23-00:17:37:02] Just ordered some more vitamins and stuff. I was just exercising. [00:17:37:06-00:17:39:22] I taped 20-Minute Workout and played it at high speed... [00:17:40:02-00:17:42:10] ...so it only took 10 minutes. I got a great workout. [00:17:42:14-00:17:44:05] Want to come in for a mineral water? [00:17:44:09-00:17:47:15] I'd really like to, Louis, but I have a rehearsal. Excuse me. [00:17:47:19-00:17:49:23] No sweat. I'll take a rain check on that. [00:17:50:03-00:17:53:14] I have plenty of low-sodium mineral water and other nutritious foods. [00:17:53:18-00:17:55:16] -But you already know that. -I know that. [00:17:55:20-00:17:58:22] Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a big party for all my clients. [00:17:59:02-00:18:00:18] My fourth anniversary as an accountant. [00:18:00:22-00:18:02:19] Even though you do your own tax return... [00:18:02:23-00:18:04:23] ...stop by, since you're my neighbor and all. [00:18:05:03-00:18:07:06] Thank you, Louis. I'll really try to stop by. [00:18:07:13-00:18:10:14] Listen, that reminds me. You shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out. [00:18:10:18-00:18:12:19] The creep down the hall phoned the manager. [00:18:12:23-00:18:14:23] That's strange. I didn't realize I left it on. [00:18:15:03-00:18:17:23] I climbed on the ledge and tried to disconnect the cable... [00:18:18:03-00:18:21:18] ...but I couldn't get in, so you know what I did, I turned up my TV real loud too... [00:18:21:22-00:18:25:05] ...so everyone would think both our TVs had something wrong with them. [00:18:25:09-00:18:28:22] Okay, so I'll see you later, huh? I'll give you a call. [00:18:29:22-00:18:32:04] I gotta have a shower. [00:18:36:05-00:18:39:10] Are you troubled by strange noises in the middle of the night? [00:18:39:14-00:18:42:16] Do you experience feelings of dread in your basement or attic? [00:18:42:20-00:18:46:02] Have you or any of your family ever seen a spook, specter or ghost? [00:18:46:06-00:18:49:21] If the answer is yes, pick up your phone and call the professionals. [00:18:50:02-00:18:51:13] Ghostbusters. [00:18:51:17-00:18:54:00] Our courteous staff is on call 24 hours a day... [00:18:54:04-00:18:56:11] ...to serve all your supernatural-elimination needs. [00:18:56:15-00:18:59:19] We're ready to believe you. [00:20:11:08-00:20:13:02] Zuul. [00:20:17:11-00:20:18:22] You don't think it's too subtle? [00:20:19:02-00:20:22:21] You don't think people are gonna drive down and not see the sign? [00:20:30:21-00:20:33:08] You can't park that here! [00:20:37:10-00:20:39:14] Everybody can relax, I found the car. [00:20:39:18-00:20:42:05] Needs some suspension work and shocks... [00:20:42:09-00:20:46:10] ...and brakes, brake pads, linings, steering box, transmission, rear end. [00:20:46:14-00:20:48:03] -How much? -Only 4800. [00:20:48:07-00:20:50:22] Maybe new rings, also mufflers, a little wiring. [00:20:55:12-00:20:57:14] -Janine, any calls? -No. [00:20:57:18-00:21:00:06] -Any messages? -No. [00:21:01:07-00:21:04:16] -Any customers? -No, Dr. Venkman. [00:21:06:02-00:21:08:02] It's a good job, isn't it? [00:21:08:14-00:21:11:15] Type something, will you? We're paying for this stuff. [00:21:11:19-00:21:15:02] Don't stare at me. You've got the bug eyes. [00:21:15:19-00:21:17:10] Janine? [00:21:17:14-00:21:20:18] Sorry about the bug eyes thing. I'll be in my office. [00:21:23:22-00:21:26:18] You're very handy. I can tell. [00:21:28:08-00:21:32:15] -I bet you like to read a lot too. -Print is dead. [00:21:33:01-00:21:36:14] Oh, that's very fascinating to me. I read a lot myself. [00:21:36:18-00:21:41:10] Some people think I'm too intellectual, but it's a fabulous way to spend time. [00:21:41:14-00:21:45:18] I also play racquetball. Do you have any hobbies? [00:21:47:02-00:21:49:20] I collect spores, molds and fungus. [00:21:54:18-00:21:56:03] Hello? [00:22:14:05-00:22:17:10] Excuse me. Is this--? This is the Ghostbusters' office. [00:22:17:14-00:22:20:12] Yes, it is. Can I help you? [00:22:20:16-00:22:24:14] I don't have an appointment. I'd like to talk to someone, please. [00:22:26:06-00:22:29:22] I'm Peter Venkman. May I help you? [00:22:30:02-00:22:35:10] Well, I don't know. What I have to say may sound a little unusual. [00:22:35:14-00:22:38:10] That's all we get, day in, day out, around this place. [00:22:38:14-00:22:42:02] -Come into my office, Miss.... -Barrett. Dana Barrett. [00:22:42:06-00:22:46:12] And this voice said, Zuul, and then I slammed the refrigerator door and left. [00:22:46:16-00:22:49:18] That was two days ago, and I haven't been back to my apartment. [00:22:49:22-00:22:53:02] Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance. [00:22:53:06-00:22:54:12] What do you think it was? [00:22:54:16-00:22:57:05] Well, if I knew what it was, I wouldn't be here. [00:22:57:09-00:22:58:22] Egon, what do you think? [00:22:59:02-00:23:02:06] She's telling the truth. At least she thinks she is. [00:23:02:14-00:23:06:23] Well, of course I'm telling the truth. Who would make up a story like that? [00:23:07:03-00:23:08:23] Some are people who just want attention. [00:23:09:03-00:23:11:06] Others are nutballs who come off the street. [00:23:11:10-00:23:15:19] You know what it could be? Past life experience intruding on present time. [00:23:15:23-00:23:18:10] Could be a memory stored in the collective unconscious. [00:23:18:14-00:23:21:19] I wouldn't rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either. [00:23:21:23-00:23:24:13] I'm sorry, I don't believe in any of those things. [00:23:24:17-00:23:29:06] Well, that's all right. I don't either. But there are some things we do... [00:23:29:10-00:23:32:15] ...standard procedures in a case like this, which often bring us results. [00:23:33:02-00:23:36:03] I could go to Hall of Records for the building's structural details. [00:23:36:07-00:23:38:18] Maybe the building has a history of psychic turbulence. [00:23:38:22-00:23:40:03] Right. Good idea. [00:23:40:07-00:23:42:10] I could search Zuul in the usual literature. [00:23:42:14-00:23:45:03] -Spates Catalog. -Tobin's Spirit Guide. [00:23:45:07-00:23:49:06] I'll take Miss Barrett back to her apartment and check her out. [00:23:49:10-00:23:53:10] I'll go check out Miss Barrett's apartment. Okay? [00:23:54:00-00:23:55:20] Okay. [00:23:56:14-00:23:58:01] Thank you. [00:24:07:06-00:24:08:16] Please, let me. [00:24:08:20-00:24:13:01] If something's gonna happen here, I want it to happen to me first. [00:24:17:08-00:24:19:10] That's the closet. [00:24:26:06-00:24:28:03] They hate this. [00:24:28:22-00:24:30:15] I like to torture them. [00:24:30:19-00:24:34:16] That's right, boys. It's Dr. Venkman! [00:24:40:06-00:24:42:07] It's a lot of space. [00:24:43:14-00:24:46:09] -Just you? -Yes. [00:24:46:22-00:24:48:08] Good. [00:24:52:11-00:24:54:21] What is that thing you're doing? [00:24:55:14-00:24:58:20] It's technical. It's one of our little toys. [00:24:59:00-00:25:00:14] I see. [00:25:02:19-00:25:06:17] That's the bedroom. But nothing ever happened in there. [00:25:09:16-00:25:11:18] What a crime. [00:25:13:17-00:25:16:17] You know, you don't act like a scientist. [00:25:16:21-00:25:21:18] -They're usually pretty stiff. -You're more like a game-show host. [00:25:28:06-00:25:30:06] That's the kitchen, huh? [00:25:42:15-00:25:44:16] -Dana, are these the eggs? -Yes. [00:25:44:20-00:25:48:02] I was over there, and these eggs just jumped right out of their shells... [00:25:48:06-00:25:50:19] -...and started to cook on the counter. -That is weird. [00:25:50:23-00:25:55:02] That's when I started to hear that awful noise coming from the refrigerator. [00:25:56:02-00:26:00:13] Dr. Venkman, You've come all this way. Would you like to check the refrigerator? [00:26:02:02-00:26:05:11] Better check the fridge. Good call. [00:26:10:12-00:26:12:20] Oh, my God. [00:26:13:09-00:26:15:22] Look at all the junk food. [00:26:16:02-00:26:18:22] -No. Goddamn it! This wasn't-- -You actually eat this stuff? [00:26:19:02-00:26:21:01] This wasn't here. There was nothing here. [00:26:21:05-00:26:24:18] There was a space and a building with flames coming out of it. [00:26:24:22-00:26:28:16] There were creatures writhing around, and they were growling and snarling. [00:26:28:20-00:26:31:14] And there were flames, and I heard a voice say, Zuul. [00:26:31:18-00:26:33:03] It was right here. [00:26:33:07-00:26:35:02] I'm sorry, I'm not getting any reading. [00:26:35:06-00:26:38:09] Well, are you sure you're using that thing correctly? [00:26:38:13-00:26:42:14] I think so. But I'm sure there are no animals in there. [00:26:42:18-00:26:44:00] Well, that's great. [00:26:44:04-00:26:47:18] Either I have a monster in my kitchen, or I'm completely crazy. [00:26:47:22-00:26:50:06] I don't think you're crazy. [00:26:50:18-00:26:53:21] Oh, good. That makes me feel so much better. [00:26:56:05-00:26:57:19] Let me tell you something about me. [00:26:57:23-00:27:01:03] I come home from work to my place, and all I have is my work. [00:27:01:07-00:27:02:20] There's nothing else in my life. [00:27:03:00-00:27:07:07] I meet you and say, There's someone with the same problem I have. [00:27:07:11-00:27:10:07] Yes, we both have the same problem. You. [00:27:14:01-00:27:16:05] I'm gonna go for broke. [00:27:18:20-00:27:21:18] -I am madly in love with you. -I don't believe this. [00:27:21:22-00:27:24:11] Will you please leave? [00:27:24:18-00:27:28:01] And then she threw me out of her life. She thought I was a creep. [00:27:28:05-00:27:31:04] She thought I was a geek, and she probably wasn't the first. [00:27:31:08-00:27:33:15] You are so odd. [00:27:37:14-00:27:40:00] -No. -I've got it! [00:27:40:04-00:27:42:23] -No. -I'll prove myself to you. [00:27:43:03-00:27:44:22] That's not necessary. [00:27:45:02-00:27:47:20] -Yeah, I'll solve your little problem. -Okay. [00:27:48:00-00:27:51:16] And then you'll say, Pete Venkman's a guy who can get things done. [00:27:51:20-00:27:53:21] -I wonder what makes him tick. -I wonder. [00:27:54:01-00:27:57:01] I wonder if he'd be interested in knowing what makes me tick. [00:27:57:05-00:27:59:19] I'll bet you're gonna be thinking about me after I'm gone. [00:27:59:23-00:28:01:15] I bet I am. [00:28:03:04-00:28:04:20] No kiss? [00:28:14:18-00:28:16:18] To our first customer. [00:28:16:22-00:28:20:00] To our first and only customer. [00:28:21:08-00:28:22:23] I'll need to draw some petty cash. [00:28:23:03-00:28:25:22] I should take her out to dinner. We don't want to lose her. [00:28:26:04-00:28:31:06] This magnificent feast here represents the last of the petty cash. [00:28:32:22-00:28:35:14] Hey, slow down. Chew your food. [00:28:36:20-00:28:39:03] Hello, Ghostbusters. [00:28:39:17-00:28:42:14] Yes, of course they're serious. [00:28:44:13-00:28:46:02] You do? [00:28:46:17-00:28:48:15] You have? [00:28:48:19-00:28:50:14] No kidding. [00:28:51:08-00:28:54:14] Well, just give me the address. [00:28:55:06-00:28:59:12] Yes, of course. Oh, they'll be totally discreet. [00:29:00:09-00:29:02:09] Thank you. [00:29:02:19-00:29:04:19] We got one! [00:29:09:16-00:29:11:10] It's a call! [00:29:18:19-00:29:20:12] Come on! [00:29:55:03-00:29:57:10] Hey, anybody see a ghost? [00:30:02:06-00:30:04:22] -Thank you for coming so quickly. -Jesus! [00:30:05:02-00:30:07:22] The guests are asking questions, and I'm running out of excuses. [00:30:08:02-00:30:09:07] Has it happened before? [00:30:09:11-00:30:12:03] Well, most of the original staff knows about the 12th floor. [00:30:12:07-00:30:13:19] -The disturbances, I mean. -Yeah. [00:30:13:23-00:30:16:22] But it's been quiet for years up until two weeks ago. [00:30:17:02-00:30:18:20] It was never, ever this bad, though. [00:30:19:00-00:30:23:02] -Did you ever report it to anyone? -No. Heavens, no. [00:30:23:06-00:30:25:20] The owners don't like us to even talk about it. [00:30:26:00-00:30:28:02] I hope we could take care of this quietly. [00:30:28:06-00:30:29:11] -It's done. -Tonight. [00:30:29:15-00:30:31:05] Yes, sir. Don't worry. [00:30:31:09-00:30:33:23] We handle this kind of thing all the time. [00:30:42:03-00:30:45:11] What are you supposed to be, some kind of a cosmonaut? [00:30:45:15-00:30:49:12] No, we're exterminators. Somebody saw a cockroach up on 12th. [00:30:49:16-00:30:54:02] -That's gotta be some cockroach. -Bite your head off, man. [00:30:57:19-00:31:01:10] -Going up? -I'll take the next one. [00:31:04:00-00:31:07:22] It just occurred to me we haven't had a completely successful test of this equipment. [00:31:08:02-00:31:10:06] -I blame myself. -So do I. [00:31:10:10-00:31:13:11] -Well, no sense worrying about it now. -Why worry? [00:31:13:15-00:31:18:04] Each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on his back. [00:31:18:08-00:31:22:19] Yep. Well, let's get ready. Switch me on. [00:31:58:18-00:32:01:13] What the hell are you doing? [00:32:02:23-00:32:05:05] -Sorry. -I'm sorry. [00:32:05:09-00:32:07:10] We thought you were someone else. [00:32:09:18-00:32:11:17] Successful test. [00:32:12:03-00:32:13:20] I guess so. [00:32:14:09-00:32:16:11] -I think we'd better split up. -Good idea. [00:32:16:15-00:32:18:14] Yeah, we can do more damage that way. [00:32:46:21-00:32:49:08] Venkman? Venkman! [00:32:57:02-00:32:59:10] Disgusting blob. [00:33:00:04-00:33:02:14] I'm gonna have to hold him myself. [00:33:44:02-00:33:45:21] Come in, Ray. [00:33:47:13-00:33:50:10] Venkman! I saw it! I saw it! [00:33:50:18-00:33:52:14] It’s right here, Ray. [00:33:52:18-00:33:54:07] It’s looking at me. [00:33:54:11-00:33:56:10] He’s an ugly little spud, isn’t he? [00:33:56:14-00:33:58:02] I think he can hear you, Ray. [00:33:58:06-00:34:00:04] Don’t move. It won’t hurt you. [00:34:07:22-00:34:09:18] Venkman! [00:34:11:14-00:34:14:06] Venkman! Pete! [00:34:16:20-00:34:18:21] Venkman, what happened? Are you okay? [00:34:19:01-00:34:20:11] He slimed me. [00:34:20:15-00:34:24:01] That’s great! Actual physical contact! [00:34:24:05-00:34:26:09] -Can you move? -Ray. Ray! Come in, please! [00:34:26:13-00:34:27:21] I feel so funky. [00:34:28:01-00:34:30:13] Spengler! I’m with Venkman. [00:34:30:18-00:34:32:05] He got slimed! [00:34:32:09-00:34:34:14] That’s great, Ray. Save some for me. [00:34:34:18-00:34:37:06] Get down here, right away! It just went into a ballroom. [00:34:37:10-00:34:38:15] Okay, we’ll be right there. [00:34:41:15-00:34:44:02] Sir, if you and your staff could please wait out here... [00:34:44:06-00:34:46:18] ...we’ll take care of everything. [00:35:05:05-00:35:07:18] There it is. On the ceiling. [00:35:10:01-00:35:12:10] That’s the one that got me. [00:35:20:02-00:35:21:10] All right, boys. [00:35:21:14-00:35:23:07] Ready? [00:35:23:11-00:35:24:19] Throw it! [00:35:34:09-00:35:35:19] I did that. I did that. [00:35:35:23-00:35:38:15] -That's my fault. -It’s okay. The table broke the fall. [00:35:39:03-00:35:41:15] There’s something very important I forgot to tell you. [00:35:41:19-00:35:44:03] -What? -Don’t cross the streams. [00:35:45:00-00:35:46:21] -Why? -It would be bad. [00:35:47:06-00:35:50:18] I’m fuzzy on the whole good/bad thing. What do you mean, bad? [00:35:50:22-00:35:54:10] Try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and every molecule... [00:35:54:14-00:35:57:01] ...in your body exploding at the speed of light. [00:35:57:18-00:35:59:11] Total protonic reversal. [00:35:59:15-00:36:03:15] Right, that’s bad. Okay, important safety tip. Thanks, Egon. [00:36:03:19-00:36:08:05] All right, Ray, take the left. Egon, take the right. [00:36:14:18-00:36:17:09] Okay, Ray, just give me one high and outside. [00:36:17:13-00:36:19:06] Ray! [00:36:21:22-00:36:23:10] Egon! [00:36:31:04-00:36:33:04] Okay, all right. Hold it, hold it, hold it! [00:36:36:16-00:36:38:06] Nice shooting, Tex! [00:36:38:10-00:36:40:18] I assure you, there is no problem with the room. [00:36:40:22-00:36:43:04] It'll be ready as soon as your guests are with us. [00:36:43:08-00:36:45:08] It took something out of him, but he'll move. [00:36:45:12-00:36:48:12] I need some room to put the trap down. Give me some room. [00:36:49:08-00:36:51:15] You’ll excuse me, please. [00:36:58:02-00:37:01:03] -Gotta get this in the clear. -Wait, wait, wait! [00:37:01:07-00:37:03:22] I’ve always wanted to do this. [00:37:04:02-00:37:05:15] And.... [00:37:05:19-00:37:08:16] -The flowers are still standing! -Okay, on my go-signal. [00:37:08:20-00:37:12:02] Spengler, I want a confinement stream from you, okay? Go! [00:37:12:06-00:37:15:00] Okay, hold him up there. He’s gonna move. Hold him up! [00:37:15:04-00:37:16:14] Go! [00:37:18:10-00:37:20:10] -It’s working, Ray. -Start bringing him down. [00:37:20:14-00:37:22:04] You got him. Don’t cross the stream. [00:37:22:08-00:37:26:12] Maybe now you’ll never slime a guy with a positron collider, huh? [00:37:26:16-00:37:30:00] Venkman, shorten your stream. I don’t want my face burned off. [00:37:30:06-00:37:33:06] I’m opening the trap now. Don’t look directly into the trap. [00:37:34:08-00:37:36:00] I looked at the trap, Ray. [00:37:36:04-00:37:40:14] Turn your streams off when I close the trap. Get ready. I’m closing it. [00:37:40:18-00:37:42:16] Now! [00:38:01:06-00:38:02:14] It’s in there. [00:38:05:21-00:38:08:02] Well, that wasn’t such a chore, now, was it? [00:38:10:21-00:38:13:04] Mr. Smith, quickly. I want that door open now! [00:38:13:08-00:38:15:02] Donald, stand over there. [00:38:15:18-00:38:18:11] We came, we saw, we kicked its ass! [00:38:18:15-00:38:20:01] Did you see it? What is it? [00:38:20:05-00:38:21:11] We got it. [00:38:21:15-00:38:23:15] What is it? Will there be any more of them? [00:38:23:19-00:38:26:19] What you had there was what we refer to as a focused... [00:38:26:23-00:38:30:17] ...non-terminal repeating phantasm, or a class-five full-roaming vapor. [00:38:30:21-00:38:32:14] Real nasty one too. [00:38:32:18-00:38:34:15] And now... [00:38:34:19-00:38:36:02] ...let’s talk seriously. [00:38:36:06-00:38:40:15] For the entrapment, we’re gonna have to ask you for four big ones, $4000. [00:38:40:19-00:38:43:23] But we are having a special this week on proton charging... [00:38:44:03-00:38:45:14] ...and storage of the beast. [00:38:45:18-00:38:48:02] That’s only gonna come to 1000 dollars, fortunately. [00:38:48:06-00:38:51:21] Five thousand dollars? I had no idea it'd be so much. I won’t pay it. [00:38:52:01-00:38:54:05] Well, that’s all right. We can just put it back. [00:38:54:09-00:38:56:06] We certainly can, Dr. Venkman. [00:38:56:10-00:39:00:01] No! All right! Anything. [00:39:00:05-00:39:01:13] Thanks so much. [00:39:01:17-00:39:03:10] Thank you. Hope we can help you again. [00:39:03:14-00:39:06:11] Coming through! One class-five free-roaming vapor. [00:39:06:15-00:39:09:14] Morning, I'm Roger Grimsby. Today, the entire Eastern seaboard... [00:39:09:18-00:39:13:00] ...is alive with talk of incidents of paranormal activity. [00:39:13:04-00:39:16:02] Alleged ghost-sightings and supernatural occurrences... [00:39:16:06-00:39:19:00] ...have been reported across the entire tri-state area. [00:39:19:04-00:39:21:14] Everybody has heard ghost stories around the campfire. [00:39:21:18-00:39:24:22] My grandma used to spin yarns about a spectral locomotive... [00:39:25:02-00:39:27:14] ...that would rocket past the farm where she grew up. [00:39:27:18-00:39:29:20] But now, as if some unforeseen authority.... [00:39:50:05-00:39:51:13] Stand aside, please! [00:39:51:17-00:39:54:20] Hi, this is Larry King. The phone-in topic, ghosts and ghostbusting. [00:39:55:00-00:39:57:16] The controversy builds, more sightings are reported. [00:39:57:20-00:39:59:08] Some maintain that these... [00:39:59:12-00:40:03:05] ...professional paranormal eliminators in New York are the cause of it all. [00:40:08:22-00:40:10:04] I got it! I got it! [00:40:11:18-00:40:12:23] Pete! Ray! [00:40:22:02-00:40:24:05] Still making headlines all across the country... [00:40:24:18-00:40:27:23] ...the Ghostbusters are at it again, this time at the dance club... [00:40:28:12-00:40:31:22] ...The Rose. The boys in gray slugged it out with a pesky poltergeist... [00:40:32:16-00:40:36:00] ...then stayed on to dance with the ladies who witnessed the disturbance. [00:40:36:04-00:40:39:05] This is Casey Kasem. Now on with the countdown. [00:40:39:09-00:40:41:12] Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. [00:40:41:16-00:40:44:09] No job is too big. No fee is too big. [00:40:45:19-00:40:48:07] Is it just a mist, or does it have arms and legs? [00:40:48:11-00:40:51:06] As they say in TV, I'm sure there's one big question... [00:40:51:10-00:40:54:11] ...on everybody's mind, and I imagine you are the man to answer that. [00:40:54:15-00:40:57:19] How is Elvis, and have you seen him lately? [00:41:42:04-00:41:44:10] Do you believe in UFOs, astral projections... [00:41:44:14-00:41:47:00] ...mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance... [00:41:47:04-00:41:50:05] ...spirit photography, telekinetic movement... [00:41:50:09-00:41:55:06] ...full-trance mediums, the Loch Ness monster and the theory of Atlantis? [00:41:55:10-00:41:59:14] If there’s a steady paycheck in it, I’ll believe anything you say. [00:42:00:18-00:42:03:18] I gotta get some sleep. I’m dying. [00:42:03:22-00:42:05:09] You don’t look good. [00:42:05:13-00:42:07:12] -I don’t? -Well, you’ve looked better. [00:42:07:16-00:42:09:07] You didn’t used to look like this. [00:42:09:11-00:42:11:09] Can you hold, please? [00:42:11:13-00:42:14:02] Here’s the paper on the Brooklyn. She paid with Visa. [00:42:14:06-00:42:16:10] Here’s tonight’s worksheet. [00:42:16:14-00:42:18:06] Oh, great. Two more free repeaters. [00:42:18:10-00:42:21:10] This is Winston Zeddmore. He’s here about the job. [00:42:21:14-00:42:24:10] Beautiful. You’re hired. Ray Stantz, Pete Venkman. [00:42:24:14-00:42:27:22] -Congratulations. -Can you help me, please? [00:42:31:08-00:42:32:20] Welcome aboard. [00:42:34:02-00:42:36:14] I don’t know where they get these guest conductors. [00:42:36:18-00:42:39:09] It’s not gonna do him much good to scream at us in German. [00:42:39:13-00:42:42:22] Well, I don’t think that the man is competent to conduct... [00:42:43:02-00:42:44:13] ...a major symphony orchestra. [00:42:45:18-00:42:50:21] -Could you wait here a minute? -Sure. [00:42:56:06-00:42:58:11] Dr. Venkman. This is a surprise. [00:42:58:15-00:43:00:22] -That was a wonderful rehearsal. -You heard that? [00:43:01:03-00:43:03:02] Yes. You’re the best one in your row. [00:43:03:06-00:43:04:16] Oh, thank you. [00:43:04:20-00:43:08:10] You’re good. Most people can’t hear me with the whole orchestra playing. [00:43:08:14-00:43:10:04] I don’t have to take this abuse. [00:43:10:08-00:43:12:15] I got hundreds of people dying to abuse me. [00:43:12:19-00:43:14:21] I know. You’re a big celebrity now. [00:43:15:01-00:43:18:06] Do you have some information for me on my case? [00:43:22:14-00:43:24:06] Who’s the stiff? [00:43:24:23-00:43:27:22] The stiff happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world. [00:43:28:02-00:43:30:00] Do you have information for me, please? [00:43:30:04-00:43:32:14] Well, sure, but I prefer to give it to you in private. [00:43:32:18-00:43:36:03] -Why don’t you tell me now. -Okay. I found the name Zuul for you. [00:43:36:07-00:43:41:19] Well the name Zuul refers to a demigod worshiped around 6000 B.C. by the.... [00:43:42:05-00:43:44:04] What’s that word? [00:43:44:09-00:43:45:22] -Hittites. -Hittites... [00:43:46:02-00:43:49:05] ...the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians. [00:43:50:02-00:43:52:14] “Zuul was the minion of Gozer.” [00:43:52:18-00:43:54:22] What’s Gozer? [00:43:55:02-00:43:59:10] -Gozer was very big in Sumeria. -Well, what’s he doing in my icebox? [00:43:59:14-00:44:02:13] I’m working on that. If we could get together Thursday night... [00:44:02:17-00:44:06:01] ...I’m thinking 9-ish, you know, we could exchange information. [00:44:06:05-00:44:09:12] I can’t see you Thursday. I’m busy. [00:44:09:16-00:44:13:02] Miss Barrett, you seem to think there is something wrong up here that says [00:44:13:06-00:44:17:10] in your mind that he enjoys taking his evenings off and spending it with his clients. [00:44:17:14-00:44:20:12] No. I’m making a special exception in your case... [00:44:20:16-00:44:22:06] ...because... [00:44:22:16-00:44:23:22] ...I respect you. [00:44:24:02-00:44:26:05] It’s corny, but I respect you as an artist. [00:44:26:09-00:44:30:11] As a dresser too. This is a magnificent coordination you have going today. [00:44:30:15-00:44:32:22] -I'll see you Thursday. -I’ll bring the Roylance Guide... [00:44:33:02-00:44:35:07] ...and we’ll eat and read. [00:44:41:22-00:44:44:04] -So who the hell is that? -He's just a friend. [00:44:44:08-00:44:45:18] -A friend? -An old friend. [00:44:45:22-00:44:47:14] Bye! Well, I’ll see you Thursday! [00:44:47:18-00:44:51:11] I’m sorry I didn’t get to meet you, sir. I’m glad you’re feeling much better. [00:44:51:15-00:44:54:12] You’re still very pale, though. A little sun. [00:44:54:16-00:44:57:08] -Well, what does he do? -He’s a scientist. [00:45:08:18-00:45:12:22] This is where we store all the vapors and entities and slimers that we trap. [00:45:13:02-00:45:18:13] Very simple, really. A loaded trap here. Open, unlock the system. [00:45:18:17-00:45:19:22] Insert the trap. [00:45:21:19-00:45:23:18] Release. [00:45:24:16-00:45:28:08] Close, lock the system. Set your entry grid. [00:45:28:12-00:45:29:22] Neutronize your field. [00:45:30:06-00:45:32:02] And... [00:45:32:06-00:45:34:21] ...when the light is green, the trap is clean. [00:45:35:01-00:45:37:23] The ghost is incarcerated here in our custom storage facility. [00:45:38:03-00:45:41:18] There’s a man from the EPA here to see you. He’s waiting in your office. [00:45:41:22-00:45:44:14] -EPA? What’s he want? -I don’t know. [00:45:44:18-00:45:47:17] All I do know is I’ve been working two weeks without a break... [00:45:48:10-00:45:50:14] ...and you promised me you'd hire more help. [00:45:50:18-00:45:53:02] Janine, someone with your qualifications... [00:45:53:06-00:45:57:02] ...would have no trouble finding a topflight job in either... [00:45:57:06-00:46:00:02] ...the food service or housekeeping industries. [00:46:00:21-00:46:05:00] -Are you gonna answer that? -I’ve quit better jobs than this. [00:46:05:18-00:46:07:15] Ghostbusters! What do you want? [00:46:07:19-00:46:10:09] -Can I help you? -I’m Walter Peck. [00:46:10:13-00:46:14:06] I represent the Environmental Protection Agency, the third district. [00:46:14:10-00:46:16:22] Great. How’s it going down there? [00:46:19:03-00:46:21:02] Are you Peter Venkman? [00:46:22:02-00:46:23:18] Yes, I’m... [00:46:23:22-00:46:25:04] ...Dr. Venkman. [00:46:25:08-00:46:28:03] Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman? [00:46:28:07-00:46:31:17] Well, I have Ph.D.'s in parapsychology and psychology. [00:46:32:11-00:46:34:07] I see. [00:46:34:11-00:46:37:08] And now you catch ghosts. [00:46:37:12-00:46:39:12] Yeah. You could say that. [00:46:39:23-00:46:42:12] And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman? [00:46:42:16-00:46:45:08] -I’m not at liberty to say. -And where do you put... [00:46:45:12-00:46:48:09] ...these ghosts once you catch them? [00:46:48:13-00:46:51:00] Into a storage facility. [00:46:51:09-00:46:54:12] And would this storage facility be located on these premises? [00:46:54:16-00:46:59:08] -Yes. -And may I see this storage facility? [00:46:59:12-00:47:02:22] -No. -And why not, Mr. Venkman? [00:47:04:12-00:47:07:18] Because you did not use the magic word. [00:47:10:00-00:47:13:14] What is the magic word, Mr. Venkman? [00:47:15:02-00:47:16:08] Please. [00:47:17:17-00:47:21:10] May I please see the storage facility, Mr. Venkman? [00:47:21:14-00:47:23:03] Why do you want to see the strorage facility? [00:47:23:07-00:47:25:14] Well, because I’m curious. [00:47:25:21-00:47:28:02] I want to know more about what you do here. [00:47:28:18-00:47:31:08] Frankly, there’ve been a lot of wild stories in the media... [00:47:31:12-00:47:34:06] ...and we want to assess any possible environmental impact... [00:47:35:01-00:47:35:18] ...from your operation. [00:47:35:22-00:47:37:22] For instance, the presence of noxious... [00:47:38:02-00:47:41:10] ...possibly hazardous waste chemicals in your basement. [00:47:41:14-00:47:45:18] Now, you show me what is down there, or I come back with a court order. [00:47:46:18-00:47:50:21] You go get a court order, and I’ll sue your ass for wrongful prosecution! [00:47:51:15-00:47:54:10] You can have it your way, Mr. Venkman. [00:47:55:00-00:47:57:12] I’m worried Ray. It's getting crowded in there, and my data... [00:47:57:16-00:48:00:11] ...points to something big on the horizon. [00:48:00:15-00:48:02:15] What do you mean big? [00:48:03:06-00:48:07:15] Well, let’s say this Twinkie represents the normal amount... [00:48:07:19-00:48:10:09] ...of psychokinetic energy in the New York area. [00:48:10:13-00:48:14:06] According to this morning’s sample, it would be a Twinkie... [00:48:14:10-00:48:17:23] ...35 feet long, weighing approximately 600 pounds. [00:48:19:10-00:48:21:02] That’s a big Twinkie. [00:48:21:06-00:48:23:12] We could be on the verge of a fourfold cross-rip... [00:48:23:16-00:48:26:06] ...a PKE surge of incredible, even dangerous, proportions. [00:48:27:18-00:48:31:04] We just had a visit from the Environmental Protection Agency. [00:48:31:08-00:48:33:13] -How’s the grid holding up? -Not good. [00:48:33:17-00:48:35:14] Tell him about the Twinkie. [00:48:36:12-00:48:38:02] What about the Twinkie? [00:49:33:08-00:49:35:14] -Oh, Dana, it’s you. -Hello, Louis. [00:49:35:18-00:49:38:14] You gotta come in here. You’re missing a classic party. [00:49:38:18-00:49:42:22] Yes, well, I would, Louis, but I have a date coming over. [00:49:46:03-00:49:47:18] You made a date... [00:49:47:22-00:49:54:04] -...tonight? -Well, I’m sorry, Louis. I forgot. [00:49:55:06-00:49:58:23] Oh, that’s okay. You can bring him along. [00:49:59:10-00:50:02:14] All right. Maybe we’ll stop by, okay? [00:50:03:01-00:50:04:14] That's great. I’ll tell everybody. [00:50:04:18-00:50:07:16] We’re gonna play Twister, we're gonna do some breakdancing.... [00:50:07:20-00:50:09:15] Hey-- [00:50:10:10-00:50:14:05] Hey, let me in! It’s Louis! Somebody, let me in! [00:50:39:07-00:50:40:20] Hello? [00:50:41:00-00:50:43:02] Hi, Mom. [00:50:43:06-00:50:44:22] I’ve been busy. [00:50:45:02-00:50:47:14] Well.... No, everything is fine. [00:50:47:18-00:50:50:23] Yeah. No, just that one time. [00:50:51:03-00:50:53:05] Oh, I am. [00:50:54:02-00:50:55:20] I will. [00:50:57:02-00:51:01:19] I won’t. Mom, I have to go. I have a date. [00:51:02:02-00:51:06:05] Yes. No, no one you know. It’s.... [00:51:07:04-00:51:09:22] Well, he’s a Ghostbuster. [00:51:10:13-00:51:12:17] Those guys on TV. [00:51:13:14-00:51:15:10] Yes, well, I’ll have to let you know. [00:51:15:14-00:51:18:02] Okay. Love to Dad. [00:51:18:06-00:51:21:20] Right. Bye. Bye. [00:51:42:05-00:51:44:06] Oh, shit. [00:52:15:18-00:52:19:00] Do you have any Excedrin or Extra Strength Tylenol? [00:52:19:04-00:52:22:10] Gee, I think all I got is acetylsalicylic acid. Generic. [00:52:22:14-00:52:26:10] I can get 600 tablets of that for the same price as 300 of the name brand. [00:52:26:14-00:52:28:19] Makes good financial sense. Good advice. [00:52:28:23-00:52:31:14] Hey, this is real smoked salmon from Nova Scotia, Canada... [00:52:31:18-00:52:32:23] ...24.95 a pound. [00:52:33:03-00:52:35:12] It only cost me 14.12 after tax, though. [00:52:35:16-00:52:37:11] I'm giving this whole thing as a promotional expense. [00:52:37:15-00:52:41:13] That's why I invited clients instead of friends. Having a good time, Marv? [00:52:41:17-00:52:44:06] How you doing? Have some Brie. It's at room temperature. [00:52:44:10-00:52:46:05] You think it's too warm for Brie? [00:52:46:09-00:52:48:13] Louis, I'm going home. [00:52:48:17-00:52:51:09] Don't leave yet. Listen, maybe if we start dancing... [00:52:51:13-00:52:53:13] ...other people will join in. [00:52:53:17-00:52:55:14] Okay. [00:52:58:08-00:53:01:06] Oh, don't move. I just gotta get the door. [00:53:02:17-00:53:04:10] -Ted! Annette! -Hi. [00:53:04:14-00:53:06:23] I’m glad you could come. Give me your coats. [00:53:07:03-00:53:09:15] Everybody, this is Ted and Annette Fleming. [00:53:09:19-00:53:11:02] How are you? [00:53:11:06-00:53:14:02] Ted has a small carpet-cleaning business in receivership. [00:53:14:06-00:53:17:12] Annette’s drawing a salary from a deferred bonus from two years ago. [00:53:17:16-00:53:21:17] They got 15,000 left on the house at 8 percent. [00:53:21:21-00:53:24:06] So they’re okay! [00:53:24:10-00:53:26:16] Does anybody want to play Parcheesi? [00:53:29:19-00:53:31:14] Okay, who brought the dog? [00:53:53:10-00:53:58:12] Help! There’s a bear loose in my apartment! Help! Help! [00:54:00:21-00:54:02:07] Help! [00:54:02:11-00:54:05:12] -What? -A bear in his apartment. [00:54:09:22-00:54:12:02] I’m gonna bring this up at the tenants' meeting. [00:54:12:06-00:54:15:14] There’s not supposed to be any pets in the building. [00:54:30:15-00:54:35:08] Let me in. There’s gotta be a way in here. I gotta get-- [00:54:38:14-00:54:41:10] Somebody, let me in! [00:54:47:18-00:54:49:02] Nice doggy. [00:54:49:06-00:54:51:04] Cute little pooch. [00:54:51:08-00:54:54:06] Maybe I got a Milk-Bone. [00:55:13:18-00:55:15:16] -Hey, what happened? -Some moron brought... [00:55:15:20-00:55:18:22] ...a cougar to a party, and it went berserk. [00:55:20:18-00:55:23:02] Hi, I'm going up to Dana Barrett's. [00:55:43:07-00:55:45:08] Hello? [00:55:47:20-00:55:50:09] That’s a different look for you, isn’t it? [00:55:50:13-00:55:52:14] Are you the Keymaster? [00:55:54:09-00:55:56:11] Not that I know of. [00:56:08:12-00:56:10:14] Are you the Keymaster? [00:56:10:18-00:56:11:23] Yes. [00:56:12:09-00:56:15:07] I’m a friend of his. He told me to meet him here. [00:56:15:23-00:56:18:13] -I didn’t get your name. -I am Zuul. [00:56:18:17-00:56:20:21] I am the Gatekeeper. [00:56:26:16-00:56:31:11] -What are we doing today, Zuul? -Prepare for the coming of Gozer. [00:56:32:06-00:56:33:19] Gozer, huh? [00:56:34:22-00:56:36:16] The Destructor. [00:56:44:23-00:56:46:05] Are we still going out? [00:56:49:08-00:56:52:22] You know, you could pick up the place if you’re expecting someone. [00:56:53:14-00:56:56:11] Do you want this body? [00:56:57:03-00:56:58:14] Is this a trick question? [00:57:02:06-00:57:04:13] I guess the roses worked, huh? [00:57:04:17-00:57:06:18] Take me now... [00:57:06:22-00:57:08:13] ...sub-creature. [00:57:08:17-00:57:10:13] We never talk anymore. [00:57:11:07-00:57:16:16] Easy. I make it a rule never to get involved with possessed people. [00:57:18:21-00:57:20:18] Actually, it’s more of a guideline than a rule. [00:57:20:22-00:57:22:07] You know, I can-- [00:57:22:11-00:57:24:21] I want you inside me. [00:57:26:04-00:57:27:19] Go ahead. No, I can’t. [00:57:27:23-00:57:30:16] Sounds like you got at least two people in there already. [00:57:30:20-00:57:32:16] Might be a little crowded. [00:57:32:20-00:57:35:02] Come on, why don’t you just quit trying... [00:57:35:06-00:57:38:09] ...to upset and disturb Dr. Venkman and just relax. [00:57:38:13-00:57:42:02] Lie down there. Relax. Put your hands on your chest. [00:57:42:06-00:57:45:02] What I’d really like to do is talk to Dana. [00:57:45:06-00:57:47:03] I want to talk to Dana. [00:57:47:07-00:57:48:17] Dana, it’s Peter. [00:57:48:21-00:57:52:14] There is no Dana. There is only Zuul. [00:57:52:19-00:57:54:17] Oh, Zuulie, you nut. Come on. [00:57:55:07-00:57:57:15] Come on, I want to talk to Dana. Dana. [00:57:57:19-00:58:00:04] Just relax. Come on. Dana. [00:58:00:08-00:58:02:07] Dana. Can I talk to Dana? [00:58:02:11-00:58:06:05] There is no Dana, only Zuul. [00:58:06:09-00:58:08:23] What a lovely singing voice you must have. [00:58:09:03-00:58:11:03] Now, I’m gonna count to three, Zuulie. [00:58:11:07-00:58:12:21] And if I don’t talk to Dana... [00:58:13:16-00:58:16:18] ...there’s gonna be some real trouble in this apartment, I think. [00:58:16:22-00:58:18:08] One. [00:58:20:17-00:58:22:09] Two. [00:58:23:23-00:58:25:14] Two and a half. [00:59:09:09-00:59:11:02] Please come down. [00:59:13:02-00:59:18:13] I am the Keymaster. The Destructor is coming. [00:59:18:17-00:59:21:18] The Traveler. The Destroyer. [00:59:27:14-00:59:29:07] Gatekeeper. [00:59:35:02-00:59:36:09] I am Vinz. [00:59:36:13-00:59:38:22] Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer. [00:59:39:02-00:59:42:17] Volguus Zildrohar, Lord of the Sebouillia. Are you the Gatekeeper? [00:59:42:21-00:59:45:19] He pulls the wagon, I make the deals. You want a ride? [00:59:55:01-00:59:58:16] Wait for the sign. Then all prisoners will be released. [00:59:58:20-01:00:02:10] You will perish in flame, you and all your kind! Gatekeeper! [01:00:02:20-01:00:04:03] What an asshole. [01:00:10:14-01:00:13:09] -Dropping off or picking up? -Dropping off. [01:00:13:13-01:00:15:13] Just a moment. [01:00:19:01-01:00:20:20] -You a Ghostbuster? -Yes. [01:00:21:00-01:00:23:04] We picked up this guy. We don't know what to do. [01:00:23:08-01:00:25:16] Bellevue doesn’t want him. I'm afraid to lock him up. [01:00:25:21-01:00:28:14] I know you guys are into this stuff, so I figured we’d check. [01:00:28:18-01:00:30:16] All right. [01:00:33:18-01:00:35:21] Are you the Gatekeeper? [01:00:38:21-01:00:41:04] You better bring him inside. [01:00:42:07-01:00:44:19] You are so kind to take care of that man. [01:00:44:23-01:00:46:21] You know, you are a real humanitarian. [01:00:47:01-01:00:49:11] I don’t think he’s human. [01:00:57:10-01:00:58:23] What did you say your name was? [01:01:00:00-01:01:02:06] Vinz Clortho, Keymaster of Gozer. [01:01:02:10-01:01:04:14] According to this, his name’s Louis Tully. [01:01:04:18-01:01:07:04] Lives on Central Park West. [01:01:08:21-01:01:11:08] Do you want some coffee, Mr. Tully? [01:01:11:14-01:01:13:13] -Do I? -Yes, have some. [01:01:13:17-01:01:14:23] Yes, have some. [01:01:17:08-01:01:20:10] Vinz, you said before you were waiting for a sign. [01:01:20:14-01:01:23:07] -What sign are you waiting for? -Gozer the Traveler. [01:01:23:11-01:01:25:17] He will come in one of the pre-chosen forms. [01:01:25:21-01:01:30:03] During rectification of the Vuldronaii, the Traveler came as a large Torb. [01:01:30:17-01:01:34:02] Then, during the third reconciliation of the Meketrex supplicants... [01:01:34:06-01:01:37:18] ...they chose a new form for him, that of a giant Sloar! [01:01:37:22-01:01:40:07] Many Shubs and Zuuls knew what it was to be roasted... [01:01:40:11-01:01:43:01] ...in the depths of the Sloar that day, I can tell you. [01:01:43:05-01:01:46:13] -Egon. -Excuse me. [01:01:48:14-01:01:51:17] There’s something very strange about that man. [01:01:53:22-01:01:56:16] I’m usually very psychic, and I have a terrible feeling... [01:01:57:10-01:01:59:22] ...that something awful is gonna happen to you. [01:02:00:19-01:02:03:12] I’m afraid you’re gonna die. [01:02:05:10-01:02:07:02] I’ll get it. [01:02:09:19-01:02:12:01] -Hello? -Egon, it’s Peter. [01:02:12:05-01:02:15:10] -Thanks, I’ve got it. -I have news from the world of Gozer. [01:02:15:14-01:02:18:18] -What is it, Peter? -I’m here with Dana Barrett. [01:02:18:22-01:02:21:14] It seems the Goz has been putting some moves... [01:02:21:18-01:02:24:18] -...on my would-be girlfriend. -How is she? [01:02:24:22-01:02:28:12] I think we can get her a guest shot on Wild Kingdom. [01:02:28:16-01:02:31:14] I just whacked her up with about 300 cc’s of Thorazine. [01:02:31:18-01:02:35:21] She’s gonna take a little nap now, but she says she’s the Gatekeeper. [01:02:36:01-01:02:38:10] -Does that make any sense to you? -Some. [01:02:38:14-01:02:41:05] I just met the Keymaster. He’s here with me now. [01:02:41:09-01:02:44:02] Oh, wonderful. We have to get these two together. [01:02:46:15-01:02:49:01] I think that would be extraordinarily dangerous. [01:02:49:05-01:02:52:13] Okay, well, hold onto him. I’ll be there in a little while. [01:02:52:17-01:02:54:22] Good. [01:02:55:02-01:03:00:00] Thank you, Vinz. We have to find Ray. I need him here immediately. [01:03:04:14-01:03:08:00] Bad news, honey, I gotta go to work. [01:03:08:04-01:03:11:02] Hey, will you stay here in bed until I get back? [01:03:21:03-01:03:25:01] -Hey, Ray, do you believe in God? -Never met him. [01:03:25:05-01:03:29:18] Yeah, well, I do. And I love Jesus’ style, you know? [01:03:29:22-01:03:33:19] This roof cap is made of a magnesium-tungsten alloy. [01:03:33:23-01:03:36:07] What are you so involved with there? [01:03:36:11-01:03:39:19] These are blueprints for the ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment... [01:03:39:23-01:03:42:18] ...and they’re very, very strange. [01:03:42:22-01:03:46:11] Hey, Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about... [01:03:46:15-01:03:50:15] ...the last days, when the dead would rise from the grave? [01:03:51:02-01:03:53:22] I remember Revelations 712. [01:03:54:09-01:03:56:11] And I looked as he opened the sixth seal. [01:03:56:15-01:03:58:14] And behold, there was a great earthquake. [01:03:58:18-01:04:01:06] And the sun became as black as sackcloth. [01:04:01:14-01:04:03:04] And the moon became as blood. [01:04:03:08-01:04:06:06] And the seas boiled. And the skies fell. [01:04:08:01-01:04:11:01] -Judgment day. -Judgment day. [01:04:11:05-01:04:14:02] Every ancient religion has its myth about the end of the world. [01:04:14:06-01:04:17:22] Myth? Ray, has it ever occurred to you... [01:04:18:02-01:04:20:06] ...maybe the reason we’ve been so busy... [01:04:20:10-01:04:23:13] ...is because the dead have been rising from the grave? [01:04:28:14-01:04:33:02] -How about a little music? -Yeah. [01:05:12:02-01:05:13:14] This way. [01:05:22:03-01:05:26:18] Excuse me. Excuse me. Just where do you think you’re going? [01:05:26:22-01:05:29:22] Step aside, or you'll be arrested for interfering with the police. [01:05:30:02-01:05:32:14] Oh, no. Hold on. I’ve seen TV. You can’t come in here... [01:05:32:18-01:05:34:09] ...without a warrant or a writ. [01:05:34:13-01:05:37:14] Cease and Desist All Commerce order. Seizure of Premises. [01:05:37:18-01:05:40:14] Ban of Public Utilities for Non-Licensed Waste Handlers... [01:05:40:18-01:05:43:13] ...and a federal Entry and Inspection order. [01:05:44:10-01:05:46:13] Vinz, there’s one more test I'd like to perform. [01:05:46:17-01:05:51:04] Egon. I tried to stop them. He says they have a warrant. [01:05:51:08-01:05:55:02] -Excuse me, this is private property. -Shut this off. Shut these all off. [01:05:55:06-01:05:58:02] I’m warning you. Turning off these machines is hazardous. [01:05:58:06-01:06:00:14] I'll tell you hazardous. You’re facing prosecution... [01:06:00:18-01:06:03:02] ...for a half-a-dozen environmental violations. [01:06:03:06-01:06:05:17] Now either, you shut off these beams, or we shut them off for you. [01:06:10:11-01:06:13:05] Understand, this is a high-voltage laser containment system. [01:06:13:09-01:06:16:05] Simply turning it off would be like dropping a bomb in the city. [01:06:16:09-01:06:19:17] Don’t patronize me. I’m not stupid, like the people you bilk. [01:06:19:21-01:06:23:08] At ease, officer. I’m Peter Venkman. There’s been a misunderstanding... [01:06:23:12-01:06:25:13] ...and I want to cooperate in any way I can. [01:06:25:17-01:06:28:06] Forget it Venkman. You had your chance to cooperate... [01:06:28:10-01:06:32:01] ...but you thought it’d be more fun to insult me. Now it is my turn, wise-ass. [01:06:32:05-01:06:34:05] He wants to shut down the protection grid. [01:06:34:09-01:06:36:23] You shut that thing down, we won't be held responsible-- [01:06:37:03-01:06:40:23] -You’ll be responsible. Shut it off. -No, we won’t be held responsible. [01:06:41:03-01:06:44:03] Don’t shut it off. I’m warning you. [01:06:45:06-01:06:47:22] I’ve never seen anything like this. I don’t know-- [01:06:48:02-01:06:51:14] Yeah, I’m not interested in your opinion. Just shut it off. [01:06:52:21-01:06:54:22] My friend, don’t be a jerk. [01:06:55:02-01:06:57:16] -Step aside. -If he does that again, you shoot him. [01:06:57:20-01:06:59:23] You do your job. Don’t tell me how to do mine. [01:07:00:03-01:07:02:22] -Thank you, officer. -Shut it off! [01:07:25:15-01:07:27:02] Oh, shit. [01:07:42:02-01:07:44:18] Clear the building! [01:08:14:02-01:08:16:20] This is it. This is the sign. [01:08:17:00-01:08:20:22] Yeah, it’s a sign, all right. We're going out of business. [01:08:30:21-01:08:32:22] Hey, aim up there. [01:08:33:09-01:08:35:07] -What happened? -Storage facility blew. [01:08:35:11-01:08:38:00] -He shut off the protection grid. -Oh, great. [01:08:38:04-01:08:39:23] -That’s bad, isn’t it? -Yeah. [01:08:40:03-01:08:42:18] -Where’s the Keymaster? -Shit. [01:08:42:22-01:08:45:05] -Who’s the Keymaster? -Oh, come on. [01:08:45:14-01:08:48:07] Hold it. I want this man arrested. [01:08:48:11-01:08:51:22] These men are in criminal violation of the Environmental Protection Act. [01:08:52:02-01:08:54:16] -This explosion is a direct result of it. -Your mother! [01:08:54:20-01:08:57:04] Come on, hold it! Hold it! Hold it! [01:09:41:15-01:09:47:14] Columbia Building, 57th Street. I’m in a hurry, so let’s not dawdle. [01:10:41:18-01:10:43:22] Hey, guard! [01:10:44:02-01:10:46:10] Look, I want to make a phone call. [01:10:46:14-01:10:49:02] I just work with these guys. I wasn’t even there. [01:10:49:06-01:10:52:10] The structure of this roof cap is like the telemetry tracker... [01:10:52:14-01:10:56:14] ...that NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in deep space. [01:10:56:18-01:11:02:21] Cold-riveted girders with cores of pure selenium. [01:11:03:01-01:11:05:03] Everybody getting this so far? [01:11:05:07-01:11:08:14] So what? I guess they just don’t make them like they used to. [01:11:08:18-01:11:11:02] No. Nobody ever made them like this. [01:11:11:06-01:11:16:01] The architect was either a certified genius or an authentic wacko. [01:11:16:05-01:11:19:06] Ray, for a moment... [01:11:19:10-01:11:22:13] ...pretend that I don’t know anything about metallurgy... [01:11:22:17-01:11:27:22] ...engineering or physics and just tell me what the hell is going on. [01:11:28:06-01:11:30:05] You never studied. [01:11:30:18-01:11:34:14] The whole building is a huge superconductive antenna... [01:11:34:18-01:11:37:04] ...that was designed and built for the purpose... [01:11:37:08-01:11:40:13] ...of pulling in and concentrating spiritual turbulence. [01:11:40:17-01:11:46:07] Your girlfriend lives in the corner penthouse of spook central. [01:11:47:19-01:11:50:08] She’s not my girlfriend. [01:11:50:12-01:11:54:00] I find her interesting because she's a client and sleeps above her covers. [01:11:54:04-01:11:58:04] Four feet above her covers. She barks. She drools. She claws. [01:11:58:08-01:12:00:18] It’s not the girl, Peter, it’s the building. [01:12:00:22-01:12:05:01] Something terrible is about to enter our world. This building is the door. [01:12:05:05-01:12:07:04] The architect’s name was Ivo Shandor. [01:12:07:08-01:12:10:23] I found it in Tobin's Spirit Guide. He was also a doctor. [01:12:11:03-01:12:13:15] He performed a lot of unnecessary surgery. [01:12:13:19-01:12:16:16] And then, in 1920, he started a secret society. [01:12:16:20-01:12:20:15] -Let me guess. Gozer worshipers. -Right. [01:12:21:12-01:12:23:00] No studying. [01:12:23:04-01:12:28:18] After World War I, Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive. [01:12:32:06-01:12:35:10] He wasn’t alone. He had close to a thousand followers when he died. [01:12:35:14-01:12:37:12] They conducted rituals up on the roof... [01:12:37:16-01:12:41:06] ...bizarre rituals intended to bring about the end of the world. [01:12:41:10-01:12:44:10] And now it looks like it may actually happen. [01:12:51:08-01:12:53:22] We have to get out of here and find a judge or something. [01:12:54:02-01:12:57:13] Hey, wait a minute. Hey, hey, hey. Hold it. [01:12:58:00-01:12:59:21] Are we actually going to go before a judge to say... [01:13:00:13-01:13:03:09] ...that some moldy Babylonian god is gonna drop in on Central Park West... [01:13:04:03-01:13:06:15] -...and start tearing up the city? -Sumerian, not Babylonian. [01:13:06:19-01:13:09:11] -Yeah, big difference. -No offense... [01:13:09:15-01:13:11:07] ...but I gotta get my own lawyer. [01:13:11:11-01:13:14:02] Okay, Ghostbusters. The mayor wants to see you guys. [01:13:14:06-01:13:16:03] The whole island’s going crazy. Let’s go. [01:13:16:10-01:13:19:11] I gotta split. The mayor wants to rap with me about some things. [01:13:43:11-01:13:47:02] -I am the Keymaster. -I am the Gatekeeper. [01:14:29:11-01:14:34:01] -Back. Back. Stay back. -Stay back. Stay back. [01:14:41:10-01:14:44:13] I’ve got a city blowing up, and you aren't giving me answers. [01:14:44:17-01:14:47:16] We’re blocking the bridges, the roads-- [01:14:47:20-01:14:49:09] The Ghostbusters are here. [01:14:49:13-01:14:52:06] The Ghostbusters. Okay, the Ghostbusters. [01:14:52:10-01:14:54:00] Hey, and where’s this Peck? [01:14:54:04-01:14:58:06] Peck. I am Walter Peck, sir, and I am prepared to make a full report. [01:14:58:10-01:15:00:19] These men are consummate snowball artists. [01:15:00:23-01:15:03:20] They use sense and nerve gases to induce hallucinations. [01:15:04:00-01:15:07:08] People think they’re seeing ghosts, and they call these bozos... [01:15:07:12-01:15:09:22] ...who show up to deal with the problem... [01:15:10:02-01:15:11:22] ...with a fake electronic light show. [01:15:12:02-01:15:14:17] Everything was fine with our system until the power grid... [01:15:14:21-01:15:17:22] -...was shut off by dickless here. -They caused an explosion. [01:15:18:21-01:15:24:00] -Is this true? -Yes, it’s true. This man has no dick. [01:15:25:14-01:15:29:13] Hey, come on. Knock it off. Hey, break it up! [01:15:29:17-01:15:31:11] -All right. -Well, that’s what I heard. [01:15:31:15-01:15:33:04] This is City Hall. [01:15:33:08-01:15:36:10] Now, what am I gonna do here, John? What is this? [01:15:36:14-01:15:39:06] All I know is that was no light show we saw this morning. [01:15:39:10-01:15:43:08] I’ve seen every form of combustion known to man... [01:15:43:12-01:15:45:09] ...but this beats the hell out of me. [01:15:45:13-01:15:48:00] The walls in the 53rd Precinct were bleeding. [01:15:48:04-01:15:50:16] -How do you explain that? -Good afternoon, gentlemen. [01:15:50:20-01:15:52:10] Oh, Your Eminence. [01:15:58:09-01:16:01:02] -How are you, Lenny? -You’re looking good, Mike. [01:16:01:06-01:16:04:19] We’re in a real fix here. What do you think I should do? [01:16:04:23-01:16:07:22] Officially, the church will not take any position... [01:16:08:02-01:16:11:10] ...on the religious implications of these phenomena. [01:16:11:14-01:16:13:02] Personally, Lenny... [01:16:13:14-01:16:17:12] ...I think it’s a sign from God. But don’t quote me on that. [01:16:17:20-01:16:19:07] Now I think that’s a smart move, Mike. [01:16:19:11-01:16:21:05] I won't call a press conference... [01:16:21:09-01:16:24:04] ...and tell everyone to start praying. [01:16:26:05-01:16:29:01] I’m Winston Zeddmore, Your Honor. [01:16:29:05-01:16:31:12] I’ve only been with the company for a couple weeks. [01:16:31:16-01:16:34:07] But I gotta tell you, these things are real. [01:16:34:17-01:16:38:12] Since I joined these men, I have seen shit that’ll turn you white. [01:16:39:09-01:16:40:23] Well, you can believe Mr. Pecker. [01:16:41:03-01:16:43:17] -My name is Peck. -Or you could accept the fact... [01:16:44:12-01:16:47:06] ...that this city is headed for a disaster of biblical proportions. [01:16:47:10-01:16:51:02] -Well, what do you mean, biblical? -What he means is Old Testament. Mr. Mayor [01:16:51:06-01:16:53:10] -Real wrath-of-God-type stuff. -Exactly. [01:16:53:14-01:16:57:00] Fire and brimstone down from the skies. Rivers and seas boiling. [01:16:57:04-01:16:59:15] Forty years of darkness. Earthquakes. Volcanoes. [01:16:59:19-01:17:01:06] The dead rising from the grave. [01:17:01:10-01:17:05:09] Human sacrifice. Dogs and cats living together. Mass hysteria. [01:17:05:13-01:17:07:17] Enough! I get the point. [01:17:09:15-01:17:10:22] But what if you’re wrong? [01:17:11:02-01:17:14:10] If I’m wrong, nothing happens. We go to jail, peacefully, quietly. [01:17:14:14-01:17:18:02] We’ll enjoy it. But if I’m right... [01:17:18:06-01:17:21:09] ...and we can stop this thing.... [01:17:21:13-01:17:26:23] Lenny, you will have saved the lives... [01:17:27:03-01:17:31:09] ...of millions of registered voters. [01:17:36:20-01:17:40:17] I don’t believe you’re seriously considering listening to these men. [01:17:48:02-01:17:50:13] Get him out of here. [01:17:50:17-01:17:53:08] -Bye. -I’ll fix you. I’m gonna fix you. [01:17:53:12-01:17:56:08] I'm gonna get you a nice fruit basket. I’m going to miss him. [01:17:56:12-01:17:57:22] All right. All right. [01:17:58:11-01:18:01:22] We got work to do. Now, what do you need from me? [01:18:15:19-01:18:17:19] Come on, let’s run some red lights! [01:19:20:18-01:19:22:14] Hello, New York. [01:19:28:18-01:19:31:13] Hello, everybody! [01:19:31:17-01:19:35:01] Dr. Ray Stantz, would you please? The heart of the Ghostbusters. [01:19:35:05-01:19:38:08] Thank you. They love you. They love you here. [01:19:38:22-01:19:43:11] -I like that shirt, friend. -Ghostbusters! All right! [01:19:46:03-01:19:49:06] Gotta run. Got a date with a ghost. [01:19:49:10-01:19:52:06] Okay, whatever happens, let’s be professional. [01:20:23:22-01:20:26:21] We might have to put a little overtime in on this one. [01:21:21:20-01:21:24:22] There they are. There they are. [01:21:31:16-01:21:34:09] I was in no way prepared for that. [01:21:35:06-01:21:38:06] It’s all right. Don’t worry. We’re fine. We can handle it. [01:21:38:10-01:21:40:18] We can take it. They want to play rough. [01:21:40:22-01:21:45:10] Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters! [01:21:47:03-01:21:48:17] -Wanna play rough? -Yeah. [01:21:48:21-01:21:50:15] Let’s do it. [01:22:15:17-01:22:17:18] Where are we? [01:22:17:22-01:22:22:01] It looks like we’re in the teens somewhere. [01:22:22:05-01:22:26:10] Well, when we get to 20, tell me. I’m gonna throw up. [01:22:57:23-01:23:02:16] -Twenty-two. Is this it? -Yep. [01:23:11:14-01:23:14:06] Art deco. Very nice. [01:23:14:10-01:23:17:06] -Where is it? -It’s at the end of the hall. [01:23:57:16-01:24:00:07] Hey, where do these stairs go? [01:24:02:22-01:24:04:14] They go up. [01:24:09:06-01:24:11:21] Okay, go ahead. Come on. Go ahead. [01:24:12:22-01:24:14:22] Watch it. Go ahead. [01:24:54:05-01:24:55:14] Dana. [01:25:09:23-01:25:13:23] Okay, so she’s a dog. [01:25:53:10-01:25:55:02] It’s a girl. [01:26:00:11-01:26:02:22] -It’s Gozer. -I thought Gozer was a man. [01:26:03:02-01:26:06:23] -It’s whatever it wants to be. -Whatever it is, it’s gotta get by us. [01:26:07:03-01:26:08:14] Right. [01:26:09:06-01:26:11:07] Go get her, Ray! [01:26:23:14-01:26:25:19] Gozer the Gozerian? [01:26:28:03-01:26:33:10] Good evening. As a duly designated representative of the city... [01:26:33:14-01:26:35:02] ...county and state of New York... [01:26:35:06-01:26:37:14] ...I order you to cease all supernatural activity... [01:26:38:00-01:26:39:14] ...and return forthwith to your place of origin... [01:26:39:18-01:26:42:18] ...or to the nearest convenient parallel dimension. [01:26:42:22-01:26:45:14] That ought to do it. Thanks very much, Ray. [01:26:45:18-01:26:48:08] Are you a god? [01:26:54:20-01:27:00:07] -No. -Then die! [01:27:24:05-01:27:30:06] Ray, when someone asks you if you’re a god, you say, “Yes.” [01:27:30:22-01:27:35:15] All right. This chick is toast. [01:27:47:22-01:27:50:10] -Got your stick? -Holding it. [01:27:52:11-01:27:53:22] Heat them up! [01:27:54:10-01:27:55:21] Smoking! [01:27:56:11-01:27:59:07] -Make them hard. -Ready! [01:27:59:11-01:28:02:19] Let’s show this prehistoric bitch how we do things downtown. [01:28:05:10-01:28:06:20] Throw it! [01:28:15:18-01:28:19:14] -Nimble little minx, isn’t she? -We better go full stream. [01:28:19:18-01:28:22:00] Aim for the flattop. [01:28:31:19-01:28:33:13] Wasn’t so hard. [01:28:39:21-01:28:41:10] We neutronized it. [01:28:41:14-01:28:44:04] You know what that means? A complete particle reversal. [01:28:44:08-01:28:47:04] And we had the tools. We had the talent. [01:28:47:08-01:28:49:15] It’s Miller time. [01:28:49:19-01:28:54:11] -Ray, this looks extraordinarily bad. -Oh, no. [01:28:54:15-01:28:56:03] What? [01:29:05:18-01:29:07:10] Look out! [01:29:30:04-01:29:36:04] Sub-creatures. Gozer the Gozerian, Gozer the Destructor... [01:29:36:08-01:29:40:22] ...Volguus Zildrohar the Traveler has come. [01:29:41:02-01:29:43:23] Choose and perish. [01:29:44:03-01:29:47:14] What do you mean, choose? We don’t understand. [01:29:47:18-01:29:53:11] Choose. Choose the form of the Destructor. [01:29:53:15-01:29:58:06] Oh, I get it. I get it. Oh, very cute. [01:29:58:18-01:30:01:15] Whatever we think of. If we think of J. Edgar Hoover... [01:30:01:19-01:30:05:02] ...J. Edgar Hoover will appear and destroy us, so empty your heads. [01:30:05:06-01:30:08:04] Don’t think of anything. We’ve only got one shot at this. [01:30:08:08-01:30:12:02] The choice is made. [01:30:12:06-01:30:14:13] The Traveler has come. [01:30:14:17-01:30:16:18] Nobody choosed anything. [01:30:16:22-01:30:18:10] -Did you choose anything? -No. [01:30:18:14-01:30:19:22] -Did you? -My mind is blank. [01:30:20:02-01:30:22:12] I didn’t choose anything! [01:30:32:02-01:30:34:00] I couldn’t help it. [01:30:34:22-01:30:37:02] It just popped in there. [01:30:37:20-01:30:41:09] What? What just popped in there? [01:30:41:13-01:30:44:10] -I tried to think-- -Look! [01:30:45:09-01:30:47:22] -No! It can’t be. -What is it? [01:30:48:02-01:30:49:20] -It can’t be. -What did you do, Ray? [01:30:50:00-01:30:52:02] Oh, shit. [01:31:03:01-01:31:05:02] It’s the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. [01:31:36:18-01:31:38:16] There’s something you don’t see every day. [01:31:38:20-01:31:40:18] I tried to think of the most harmless thing. [01:31:40:22-01:31:42:21] Something I loved from my childhood. [01:31:43:01-01:31:47:20] Something that could never, ever possibly destroy us. Mr. Stay Puft. [01:31:48:00-01:31:50:02] Nice thinking, Ray. [01:31:51:00-01:31:53:00] We used to roast Stay Puft marshmallows... [01:31:53:04-01:31:55:00] ...by the fire at Camp Waconda. [01:31:56:19-01:32:01:02] Ray, has gone bye-bye, Egon. What have you got left? [01:32:01:11-01:32:06:14] Sorry, Venkman. I’m terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought. [01:32:16:14-01:32:19:14] -Oh, no. -Mother pus bucket. [01:32:24:08-01:32:26:21] Nobody steps on a church in my town. [01:32:27:01-01:32:30:00] One, two, three, roast him. [01:32:49:19-01:32:51:10] Funny, us going out like this. [01:32:51:14-01:32:54:00] Killed by a 100-foot marshmallow man. [01:32:54:04-01:32:57:07] We’ve been going about this all wrong. This Mr. Stay Puft is okday. He's a sailor. [01:32:58:01-01:33:01:07] He’s in New York. We get this guy laid, we won’t have any trouble. [01:33:05:06-01:33:08:06] I have a radical idea. The door swings both ways. [01:33:08:21-01:33:10:18] We could reverse the particle flow through the gate. [01:33:10:22-01:33:12:22] How? [01:33:13:02-01:33:15:09] -We'll cross the streams. -Excuse me, Egon. [01:33:15:13-01:33:17:06] You said crossing the streams was bad. [01:33:17:10-01:33:20:14] -Cross the streams. -You’re gonna endanger us. [01:33:20:18-01:33:22:12] You’re gonna endanger our client... [01:33:22:16-01:33:25:17] ...the nice lady who paid us in advance before she became a dog. [01:33:25:21-01:33:29:22] Not necessarily. There’s definitely a very slim chance we’ll survive. [01:33:35:15-01:33:39:10] I love this plan. I’m excited to be a part of it. Let’s do it. [01:33:39:14-01:33:43:06] This job is definitely not worth 11,500 a year. [01:33:46:22-01:33:48:10] Hurry. [01:33:50:08-01:33:52:18] See you on the other side, Ray. [01:33:54:23-01:33:57:15] Nice working with you, Dr. Venkman. [01:34:06:01-01:34:07:18] Let's turn them on, Spengler! [01:34:10:23-01:34:13:06] Now, Spengler! [01:34:18:12-01:34:20:09] Get out of here! [01:35:13:14-01:35:15:02] Winston. [01:35:16:01-01:35:17:18] Are you all right? [01:35:23:00-01:35:24:10] Venkman? [01:35:24:14-01:35:25:22] Spengler! [01:35:26:22-01:35:28:10] Venkman! [01:35:31:20-01:35:33:08] Spengler. [01:35:34:17-01:35:37:13] Oh, Spengler. Oh, are you okay? [01:35:37:17-01:35:39:19] I feel like the floor of a taxicab. [01:35:39:23-01:35:42:03] -Venky! -Yeah, where are you? [01:35:42:07-01:35:44:15] Oh, thank God. [01:35:45:18-01:35:47:14] -You okay? -I’m all right. [01:35:47:18-01:35:49:02] -You all right? -I’m all right. [01:35:49:06-01:35:51:13] -You all right? -Yeah. You okay? [01:35:51:17-01:35:53:05] Fine. [01:36:01:14-01:36:04:12] It smells like barbecued dog hair. [01:36:05:00-01:36:06:23] Oh, Venkman. [01:36:07:03-01:36:09:08] Oh, Venkman, I’m sorry. [01:36:10:01-01:36:12:23] I’m sorry. I just-- I just forgot. [01:36:27:08-01:36:28:22] Look! [01:36:56:02-01:36:58:20] Somebody turn on the lights! [01:36:58:23-01:37:02:05] -Help! Somebody! -Go check on that little guy. [01:37:07:17-01:37:09:15] What happened? [01:37:18:20-01:37:20:14] Where am I? [01:37:22:11-01:37:25:13] Oh, hi. [01:37:25:23-01:37:27:18] You’ll be all right. [01:37:28:06-01:37:31:18] Boy, the superintendent’s gonna be pissed. [01:37:33:06-01:37:35:04] Are you okay? [01:37:35:20-01:37:37:17] Who are you guys? [01:37:37:21-01:37:39:23] We’re the Ghostbusters. [01:37:42:18-01:37:44:04] Who does your taxes? [01:37:44:22-01:37:48:01] You know, Mr. Tully, you are a most fortunate individual. [01:37:48:05-01:37:50:12] -I know. -You have been a participant in... [01:37:50:16-01:37:54:13] ...the biggest interdimensional cross rip since the Tunguska blast of 1909. [01:37:54:17-01:37:56:14] -Felt great. -We’d like to get a sample... [01:37:57:04-01:37:59:15] -...of your brain tissue. -Okay. [01:38:02:18-01:38:05:10] I love this town! [01:38:49:06-01:38:51:06] Egon! [01:38:58:05-01:39:00:02] What’s going on? [01:39:01:05-01:39:03:14] Does anybody want to interview me? [01:39:03:18-01:39:07:03] I’m an eyewitness. I was up there. [01:39:07:16-01:39:09:20] I want to go with them in the car.</property>
